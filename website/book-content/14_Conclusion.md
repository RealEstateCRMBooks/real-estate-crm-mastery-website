# Conclusion

As a real estate agent, your database is your most valuable business
asset. Your CRM helps you keep an up-to-date, unified address book that
syncs with your smartphone. To maintain accuracy, use it regularly.

By maintaining a balanced mix of new prospects and past clients, you can
maximize your results. For past clients, stay in touch through strategic
client appreciation outreach, Christmas greetings, and periodic “just
called to say hi” phone calls. New prospects can be automatically added
via email feed, valet import, and open-house web forms. 

You can automate your follow-up using time-release drip emails, printed
letters, postcards, phone calls, and text messages. This can all be
coordinated utilizing the touch cycle.

CRMs do much more than store your calendar and contacts. Mastering
advanced features is what sets successful agents apart. Transactions can
be tracked and automated through task plans. As you grow, you can bring
on an assistant or partner and stay accountable with a coach and the
goals section of your real estate CRM.

One thing people sometimes overlook is that your CRM is also a
relationship manager. It lets you monitor the personal lives of
thousands of people at once. Your aim isn’t just to fill your database
with contacts; it’s to use that database to connect with people and get
to know them. While a healthy database won’t close deals on its own, it
will support you at every stage of the process.
