# Keeping In Touch

—Mario Jannatpour, *The Honest Real Estate Agent*

Your database of past clients, prospects, and friends is your most
valuable asset. To keep this information accurate and maintain your
relationships, it’s essential to connect with them regularly. This
chapter explains how to use your real estate CRM to nurture your
relationships through consistent communication via email, texting,
postal mailings, newsletters, and eCards. I will demonstrate how to
track engagement and use these communications to maintain the accuracy
of your database.

## 360 Degree Outreach

I recommend reaching out to your prospects and contacts through multiple
channels, including phone calls, text messages, emails, drop-ins,
eCards, and postcards. Some people prefer speaking on the phone. Others,
especially younger individuals, are less likely to answer calls but more
likely to reply to text messages. Still others might prefer email, while
others will be most impressed by meeting you in person. Using different
communication methods lets you connect with the people in your database
in a meaningful, memorable way. If you rely on only one form of
communication, like email, you’re not able to make the kind of impact
you can by taking advantage of multiple forms.


> **Text After Voice Secret:** When you call a lead and they don’t answer, do not leave a voicemail. Instead, send them a text message along the lines of “Hi Sally, this is Josh Wheeler, from RE/MAX. I just tried calling you to give you an update about the house on Main Street. When is a good time for a quick chat?”


While personalized one-on-one communication is the ideal way to build
and maintain relationships, mass communication methods, such as bulk
email and postcards, also have value. You will see the best results when
you combine personalized messages with mass communication. The most
effective form of mass communication is sending an annual Christmas card
to everyone you know.


Regardless of which communication method you choose, your real estate
CRM helps manage and coordinate your efforts to achieve the best
results. You can use the built-in content library to send printed
letters, scheduled drip emails, eCards, and flyers. You can also use the
text message chat feature to send text messages, and your CRM can even
dial your mobile phone for follow-up calls. Don’t overlook the
effectiveness of postal mail either. Your CRM can assist by printing
mailing labels, creating mail-merged letters, and exporting targeted
mailing lists for mailing houses to send postcards.


> **Lucky Ladder Secret:** Your aim in every prospect interaction is to communicate as interactively as possible. Think of communication methods as rungs on a ladder. At the bottom are email exchanges; a little higher are text messages; even higher are phone conversations. You should always work to climb the ladder by moving away from one-sided communication. Your ultimate goal? Meeting face to face.


One of the main advantages of using a real estate CRM is that it helps
you gradually collect contact information. In lead nurturing, having
multiple communication channels increases the chances of turning a lead
into a client. Additionally, offering multiple connection methods
provides backup options if one fails. For example, if you only have an
email address and that person changes their email address, you might be
stuck—unless you also have their phone number!

You should also add notes to the contact records in your database about
how you communicated and what you discussed. For example, you might have
called on a weekday at 5 pm and left a voicemail. The next time you try
to contact that person, you might try a different time or use a
different method, such as a text message. Calling someone can be tricky,
as many people screen their calls and may not answer, especially during
business hours. So, the chances of someone answering when you call might
be quite low.

I recommend maintaining a use-it-or-lose-it strategy for managing your
database. If you haven’t reached out to someone in your database in over
2 years, consider deleting their record. If you don’t remember them,
delete their contact—they probably won’t remember you either.

Maintain regular contact with everyone in your database. This keeps you
top of mind as the helpful real estate agent who is always available to
assist. Additionally, consistent outreach helps ensure their mailing
addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses remain accurate. People
often change their contact details, and your clients are especially
likely to do so—after all, they’re considering moving! Send a Christmas
card each year to confirm their mailing address, an eCard at least
annually to verify their email address, and call them at least once a
year.

## Email Deliverability

When you send an email from your CRM, several processes occur behind the
scenes to maximize the likelihood that your email is delivered and read,
a metric known as deliverability.

About 48% of all emails sent are spam[34]. Spam is unsolicited bulk
email. Every email recipient has a spam filter that decides whether your
email is spam. This automated process considers many factors, including
your server’s email reputation, the email’s content, the sender’s
identity, and the history of emails exchanged between the sender and
recipient. When an email is flagged as spam, it goes to the recipient’s
spam folder. In extreme cases, the email may be rejected or
automatically deleted. This can happen if the original email contains or
is suspected of containing malware, such as a virus.


To maximize deliverability, your CRM vendor employs a **postmaster**
whose role is to ensure the CRM’s mail servers maintain a good
reputation with other email servers. Each email server has a reputation
based on the quality of the emails it sends. The reputation of your
CRM’s email server is one factor used to determine whether your emails
will be placed in the recipient’s spam folder. If the sending server’s
reputation is particularly poor, the server itself can be blacklisted,
causing all emails from that server to be automatically routed to the
recipient’s spam folder or even blocked from delivery entirely, a
process called blacklisting.

For this reason, the postmaster is primarily responsible for ensuring
that a single bad actor does not harm the server’s reputation, which
could reduce the deliverability of all the other agents’ emails. This is
a labor-intensive job that free CRM or low-quality vendors often lack,
leading to disastrously low email open rates.

When you send an email, your CRM monitors whether it was successfully
delivered. A failed delivery is called a hard bounce and shows that the
email address is invalid or no longer active. Sending many hard-bounced
emails can harm your email reputation. To prevent this, your CRM keeps a
list of invalid email addresses that have hard-bounced. As a precaution,
it automatically avoids sending emails to addresses that have previously
hard-bounced.


> **Unread Alert Secret:** Your CRM tracks when an email is sent but not opened and read. If several emails aren’t being read, they may be ending up in spam or the recipient may no longer be using that email address. Usually, four emails in a row are considered a red flag. Your CRM may identify these low-engagement records by adding a category called “Unread” To those records. If that happens, stop sending additional emails, as it could damage your email reputation. Instead, contact this person through another method, like a phone call.


Along with automated spam filters, the recipient of your emails can also
manually mark any email as spam. They do this by clicking the spam icon
in their email program. When they do that, your email goes to the spam
folder, and both the email server and your CRM are notified that any
emails from you should be considered unwelcome. After this, future
emails you send to that person will automatically go to their spam
folder.

You might wonder why people click the spam icon instead of the
unsubscribe link in an email. Maybe they opted out earlier, but the
emails keep coming, so they become angry. Or perhaps they don’t trust
the sender and want to alert the authorities. A complaint rate of 1
complaint per 1,000 emails sent is considered reasonable, but higher
rates can harm your reputation and increase the likelihood that all your
future emails will be automatically marked as spam.

If you continue sending emails to someone who has marked one of your
messages as spam, your email server’s reputation could be harmed.
Therefore, your CRM will monitor all spam complaints and automatically
stop you from sending any more emails to that address.

Mail servers regularly share their lists of senders flagged for spam.
For example, if you send an email to someone with an AOL address and
they mark it as spam, AOL’s servers will share that information with
Yahoo, Hotmail, Outlook, and other email services that may be
interested. While this sharing doesn’t automatically block all emails
from you, it warns other email servers that your address might be
suspicious, prompting them to proceed with caution.

Federal regulations require all bulk emails to include a physical
mailing address and an opt-out option. Your CRM automatically adds this
information to all your email communications to ensure compliance with
federal laws.

Your CRM also tracks when someone opens and reads your email. This is
done by including an invisible image in each email. When the email is
opened, the image loads, and the CRM’s servers then record that your
recipient has opened it. If you send multiple bulk emails, you can
analyze trends and see whether a specific mailing has a notably high or
low open rate. A typical open rate for bulk email is around 31%. You can
also check whether your open rate is declining month to month. This
might indicate email fatigue, meaning you’re sending emails too often or
that recipients are no longer interested in your content.

When you send an email, the recipient’s spam filter checks whether your
email address is in their address book and whether you have exchanged
emails before. Both factors are considered positive and significantly
reduce the likelihood of your email being flagged as spam. That makes
your first contact the most important. If you’re sending someone their
first email, ask them to reply with a quick note confirming they
received it. That helps train their spam filter to recognize you as
safe. You can think of this like visiting someone’s house and having
their dog sniff you in front of the owner so the dog knows you’re OK and
will consider you a friend in the future.

First impressions count, especially in email subject lines. In a crowded
inbox, your subject line often determines whether your message is opened
or deleted. It also helps spam filters decide whether your email belongs
in the inbox or the spam folder. Attention-grabbing subject lines can
trigger spam filters. The best approach is to use a subject line you
might send when emailing a friend. It’s wise to avoid tactics spammers
use to make their subject lines stand out. Spam filters are constantly
evolving and getting better at detecting old tricks. Avoid using ALL
UPPER CASE or replacing letters with special characters to make your
email look more appealing. Overuse of punctuation or emojis in email
subjects can flag your message as spam. Avoid words like “money,”
including a large dollar amount, alluding to a get-rich-quick scheme, or
offering spam filters that call a “free lunch,” which is something for
nothing. When something looks too good to be true, spam filters become
suspicious. Just including the word “free” can sometimes be enough to
send your email to the spam folder.

Your goal is to make sure your emails aren’t mistaken for spam or scams.
Since most people read emails on their smartphones, avoid long subject
lines, as those won’t display well on small screens. Also, don’t reuse
the same subject line for multiple emails to the same recipient, as it
can confuse both recipients and spam filters. Is this the same email
sent twice or a new one? If they delete your first message without
opening it, their spam filter might remember that and start sending
future messages with the same subject line to the spam folder.

### Bob Licher

Once an agent becomes successful enough, they’ll need to start building
a team to keep up their quality of service. For the Colorado real estate
agent Bob Licher, he learned this in an unexpected place: from his life
as a musician. To build a strong band, you need to assemble a group of
talented and driven individuals who share a common goal. Bob says that
even when you’ve made your perfect band, you still need to listen to the
audience. “If you’re not feeling the room, you won’t connect,” Bob says.
“Real estate’s the same way. You must read people, know what they need,
and respond.” With over 14 years of helping clients buy and sell homes
across the Front Range, Bob has built his reputation on one key
principle: relationships first. “It’s obviously a relationship
business,” Bob explains. “What’s important is keeping the customer
service on point. Prospecting and marketing are aspects of that service,
and I can’t do it all on my own.” After years in “big box” brokerages,
Bob launched his own company and built a team to support it. Even with a
well-communicating team, individual team members may find themselves on
different pages. “Our CRM system keeps the team in tempo,” says Bob. “It
makes sure our entire team is working the same way, and our follow-ups
are on track. I can see what’s working or what needs to be fixed.”
Becoming part of a real estate team can seem daunting, but it also
offers the benefit of learning from others and being stronger together
than as individuals.

—«◊»—

Always include a call to action at the end of each email. Invite them to
visit your website to learn more, reply to your email, or call you.
Emailing someone without expecting a reply or phone call isn’t helping
you. Your main goal should be to create a back-and-forth conversation.

Your real estate CRM offers a library of letters that follow all these
guidelines, pass spam filters, and are clear and engaging for your
prospects. You can personalize these email templates to better reflect
your personality, and they serve as a great starting point for your
email outreach.


> **Postscript Powerplay Secret:** Eye-tracking studies show that the postscript, or “P.S.”, is one of the most-read parts of any email, often getting more attention than the body of the message itself. The P.S. last thing your reader will see and the first thing they will act on, so make your P.S. count.


Most people will read your emails on their mobile phones, so keep the
formatting simple and the length as short as possible. Excessive
formatting can make your email harder to read on a smartphone screen and
cause readers to lose focus more quickly. Stick to one font and avoid
jarring changes in font size and style. You should also limit the use of
color in the text, as it can be distracting and look unprofessional. 

I recommend including a letterhead with a portrait photo and a company
logo at the top of your emails. This way, your recipient sees that
information immediately and recognizes your email as legitimate, not
spam. If they read your email on a smartphone, they might need to scroll
to see your signature at the bottom, so placing your branding at the top
ensures they see it even if they don’t have time to read the full email
right away. Even if they don’t reach the end, they will already know who
you are. 

You should also include a signature at the bottom of each email with
your name, job title, brokerage, and phone number. Keep your signature
simple so it doesn’t overshadow the email content. Too many contact
options can lead to decision paralysis when someone decides to call you.

Never include an email address in your emails that differs from the one
you use to send them. This is something scammers do, and you don’t want
your email to look like a scam.

It's common to include images in your emails. If you add images, be sure
to include some text as well. Spam filters sometimes flag emails
containing only images as suspicious. Spammers may try to bypass spam
filters by embedding their content in an image, hoping to trick the
filter into ignoring the text within the image. Another consideration is
that some people might view your emails with images turned off, which is
common in high-security situations, such as those involving bank
officers, attorneys, and others with strict security requirements.

## Newsletters

While a newsletter can still be part of your promotional strategy, it
should be viewed as just one of many channels for sharing your content,
alongside modern formats such as your website and social media. One
challenge with sending a monthly newsletter is that it can lead to high
unsubscribe rates and low open rates due to reader fatigue.


> **Seasonal Send Secret:** Send your newsletter only twice a year in the fall and again in the spring. This maximizes the impact of your market updates.


If you send your newsletter via email, a deliverability strategy is
essential. Your CRM automatically tracks opt-outs, invalid addresses,
and spam complaints to help you maintain a clean list. It can also
monitor who has read your newsletter. Your open rate significantly
influences how spam filters treat your emails; if recipients
consistently ignore your newsletter, future messages may end up in their
spam folders. Regularly check your open rates. If you notice a decline,
a high number of opt-outs, or complaints, consider narrowing your
distribution[35]. The postmaster of your real estate CRM is a valuable
resource and can provide statistics to help identify issues.

Finally, consider alternative distribution options for your content
instead of creating your own newsletter. Some brokerages and franchises
offer a joint newsletter in which agents share mailing lists. This
approach requires less work and can be ideal for agents who lack the
time to produce their own content. You might also contribute to existing
newsletters from local organizations. Many schools, churches, and
community groups publish newsletters, and you can often place an ad for
a small fee and benefit from their established distribution. You might
also focus on social media instead, which allows you to reach an
audience beyond your mailing list.

Once you’ve established your overall strategy, the content of your
newsletter will ultimately determine its success. Your newsletter should
highlight your expertise in the local real estate market. Avoid generic
articles, such as home improvement projects with the best returns,
because this information is readily available online and offers little
added value.

Remember, your newsletter is selling YOU, so it should offer information
only you are uniquely qualified to provide. Keep it local and fresh.
Because you focus on real estate in a specific area, your newsletter
should feature hyper-local content. Just-listed and just-sold homes are
a great starting point, helping homeowners gauge home appreciation and
giving potential buyers a sense of current market prices.

Be sure to include regional trends in home prices. Are home prices
trending upward? How do they compare with state and national levels?
Discuss new construction projects, such as shopping malls or new home
developments, and share your expert insight into how they might affect
the community and property values[36].

Non-real-estate content can also work well, as long as it’s local.
Consider reviewing a new shop or restaurant in your neighborhood or
sharing information about local fundraisers and charity events.

Finally, avoid certain types of content. For example, including a recipe
is common, but it doesn’t support your message as a local real estate
expert. If you’re proud of your apple pie, bake one for your next open
house and include the recipe on the back of the flyer. The smell will
create a memorable connection to the property, making it a much more
effective use of your culinary skills.

Consider collaborating with a local mortgage broker, who can provide
valuable content on interest rates and refinancing, and with whom you
can share costs, effort, and distribution lists. Other potential
partners include home stagers and local moving companies.

I recommend sending a newsletter no more than twice a year, once in the
spring and once in the fall. The higher the frequency of your
newsletter, the greater the likelihood that people will unsubscribe.
Instead, I recommend treating your newsletter as part of a multichannel
approach to staying in touch with your prospects. Make sure each
newsletter’s subject is unique by including the month and year in the
newsletter’s subject line to prevent it from looking identical to
previous editions. 

A newsletter does not eliminate the need to call, text, drive by, and
even send postcards to your prospects. You can use drip emails, a
sequence of highly targeted emails delivered over time, as well. The
advantage of a drip sequence over a newsletter is that your newsletter
addresses the general market, whereas a drip sequence can address the
specific life circumstances of the recipient. For example, a first-time
homebuyer could receive a targeted sequence of emails educating them on
the home-buying process. When you use multiple communication channels,
the results are synergistic. You can maintain regular contact without
being overwhelming.

Avoid traditional multi-column layouts, as they are hard to read on
mobile devices. A single-column email body performs best with spam
filters and readers. Most people will scan your email first, then decide
whether to read it thoroughly. Short, straightforward messages are often
the most effective. Given modern readers’ limited attention spans, keep
your content concise and ideally to a single page. Consider including a
snippet of your newsletter and a link to your website or blog for the
rest. This approach keeps your emails easy to read while also driving
traffic to your site and increasing your visibility in Google search
results.

Finally, incorporate modern media into your plan. Video content is
increasingly popular, so consider creating a short YouTube video for
each article. Video doesn’t replace written content; it complements it,
making it easier for search engines to understand. Combining a
well-written blog post with an embedded video is an ideal formula for
online promotion. Your CRM can **embed videos in your emails**. When you
do this, a thumbnail image of the video appears inline in the email body
with a prominent play button. When clicked, the video player opens.
While YouTube is the most common video platform, other options such as
Vimeo and Vidyard are also available.

Once you’ve created your content, decide who will receive your
newsletter. Add a “Newsletter” category to the people in your database
who should receive your newsletter. Sending your newsletter to everyone
in your database is a mistake, as it can lead to many people opting out.
While your mother might love to hear from you more often, that
newsletter isn’t what she had in mind! You should definitely avoid
sending your newsletter to vendors and other real estate agents. It is
simply a matter of courtesy. When you contact these people, it should be
for something important, such as presenting an offer or getting a vendor
to assist with one of your listings. The worst possible outcome is being
unable to reach these key parties via email because they previously
marked your emails as spam.

Some real estate CRMs offer a **generic newsletter** you can personalize
and send. This is a particularly risky practice because generic content
is far more likely to be flagged as junk than hyperlocal, personal
content. If you send that newsletter monthly, you should expect at least
half of your database to unsubscribe within the next 12 months. You
might tell yourself that people who opt out are not potential clients,
so good riddance. Instead, consider that you’re making a bad impression
with a generic newsletter sent too often. When done properly,
newsletters can be a useful part of your overall strategy. But they
cannot replace the personal attention a top agent provides to their
friends through phone calls, birthday wishes, and physical Christmas
cards.

## eCards

In addition to a letter library, your real estate CRM includes an eCard
library. These are emails featuring an animated image and text, similar
to a greeting card. eCards offer several benefits. They’re easy to read
on a phone and don’t take much time to send or view. Past clients who
know you well might be more receptive to a quick greeting than a lengthy
monthly newsletter, especially if they recently bought a home with you
and aren’t very interested in current market trends. Sometimes, just
checking in means more than the message itself.

Like a greeting card, eCards can be used to wish someone a happy
holiday, “Get Well Soon,” or “Happy Birthday.” They are best suited for
reconnecting with someone you already know. Receiving a greeting card
from someone you’ve never met can be a little disconcerting. Birthdays
and home anniversaries are perfect occasions to send an eCard. They are
personalized for the individual, and for a home anniversary, they can be
directly relevant to your relationship with past clients. Few things
provide a better reason to reach out to someone unexpectedly. The
ability to schedule your greeting cards makes it even easier, and your
CRM can automate this process. That way, you never miss an important
date.


> **The eCard Engagement Secret:** Sending a friendly holiday eCard helps you maintain a healthy database. Active contacts will open your email, while inactive ones won’t, and invalid email addresses can also be identified. Use these results to see who’s still engaged and remove invalid or inactive people from your database.


Holidays like Halloween, the 4th of July, and Easter are great times to
send an eCard. While a birthday eCard is sent to someone on a specific
day, a holiday eCard is usually sent as a bulk email to many people at
once. Not everyone wants to read a monthly newsletter full of market
analysis. Often, a short, simple greeting does the same job of staying
in touch and remaining top-of-mind. It doesn’t have to say much, but it
reminds them you’re there when they need you. There are holidays all
year round. Pick one or two that matter to your audience and use them as
check-ins.

While easy to send, eCards should be used sparingly. Sending a monthly
eCard can clutter inboxes and dilute the impact of your more personal
messages. Think of eCards as a supplement to your high-touch
communication, not a replacement. Use them for minor holidays like
Halloween or the 4th of July as a friendly, low-stakes touchpoint. They
also serve a second purpose: verifying email addresses in your database.

I recommend sending one or two eCards each year to friends, family, and
past clients. For special occasions like birthdays and home
anniversaries, consider combining phone calls and texts with eCards,
alternating each year. For bulk eCards, you might send them on different
holidays each year. For example, if you sent an eCard for Easter and
Halloween this year, try sending one for New Year’s and Thanksgiving
next year. By keeping things fresh, you reduce the risk of email
fatigue, which occurs when you send too many emails too quickly,
prompting recipients to complain or opt out to stop the flood of
messages.

Sending eCards also helps you keep your database accurate. About 22
percent of email addresses become invalid each year as people switch
providers[37]. Your real estate CRM tracks these issues by marking
invalid emails as HardBounces and flagging contacts who have not opened
multiple messages. This information is ideal for identifying people you
should contact by an alternative means, such as a phone call. This is a
good opportunity to reach out and check in on how things are going. One
notable reason someone might change their email address is that they
have moved.

## Mailing Labels and Postcards

In an era of overflowing inboxes and spam filters, physical mail remains
one of the most reliable ways to reach your clients. A tangible item
they can hold is more memorable and impactful than a fleeting email.
Your real estate CRM can handle your physical mailings in three main
ways. First, you can export a CSV file of the mailing list for use with
a mailing house such as ReaMark, ProspectsPlus, or SendSations. This
works well for bulk postcards[38]. Second, you can **print a batch of
labels or envelopes** directly from your CRM, perfect for Christmas
mailings or bulk letters you want to send by hand. Finally, you can
print individual labels or envelopes from a queue of letters within your
CRM. This last option is ideal for personalized, time-release drip
letters or postcards, which you can schedule using a time-release drip
sequence[39].

### Pete Doty

In an age where inboxes are crowded and attention spans are short, Pete
Doty, a top-producing agent in Littleton, Colorado, cuts through the
noise with old-fashioned postal mail. After more than 30 years in real
estate, Pete knows that a personal touch with a bit of humor never goes
out of style. “I keep in touch through a series of personal notes,
postcards, and form letters,” Pete says. “Each one is designed with a
humorous touch, but lets them know I’m serious.” Every morning at 6
a.m., Pete spends one to two hours working his system. He pulls letters
from his CRM’s drip sequences, edits them, and prints them for mailing.
It’s a daily ritual that keeps his pipeline full and his name top of
mind. “It’s a numbers game, but I don’t waste money or effort,” he
explains. Instead of blanketing neighborhoods with generic Every Door
Direct Mail (EDDM), Pete hand-selects about 300 contacts to nurture
personally. At least every three months, he will send witty, heartfelt
messages to each one. “A stranger isn’t likely to make a connection with
me through these letters,” he says. “But they’ll remember me if I’m
consistent enough, and they’ll reach out when they need me.” He
attributes one postcard to a $1 million increase in gross sales. It was
called “Are you sick of my face yet? Let’s fix this.” Pete is always on
someone’s mind by using a bit of humor, old-school charm, and the
efficiency of a modern CRM.

Postcards offer significant advantages over printed letters. They
achieve higher response rates because their message is easily
accessible. Even if someone plans to toss a postcard in the trash, they
can’t help but quickly scan the front and back. Sending postcards is
also more affordable than mailing a regular first-class letter, thanks
to lower material, handling, and postage costs. For these reasons,
postcards are an excellent tool for geographic farming. I recommend
sending “just listed” and “just sold” postcards to the neighborhood of
each of your listings, once when you get the listing and again when the
listing closes.

You should also send postcards to your geographic farm in the fall and
spring, with updates on the latest sales and listings in the area. For
large mailings, your best option is an online postcard service. These
services print and mail your postcards; all you need to do is **export a
mailing list as a CSV file**. Using these services can help reduce
postage costs by taking advantage of bulk mail presorted rates. If your
goal is to send a postcard to everyone in a neighborhood, you can use
the postal service’s Every Door Direct Mail (EDDM) service. This program
allows you to mail postcards to every address on a specific mail
carrier’s route without needing individual names or addresses, which can
significantly lower your postage and list-purchasing costs.


> **The Primary Post Principle:** Mail postcards for vacation properties to the owner’s primary home address, not the address of the vacation property. Your marketing gets read instead of rotting in an empty, “ghost” mailbox for months.


While postcards are useful for general marketing, printed letters offer
the privacy needed for more sensitive prospecting, such as probate or
pre-foreclosure leads. Your real estate CRM can **print mail-merged
letters**, along with printed envelopes or mailing labels. With your
handwritten signature, printed letters add a level of professionalism
ideal for situations where you’re offering professional services and
positioning yourself as a trusted advisor.

For targeted mailings of individual letters or postcards, you can use
your real estate CRM’s **label-printing** feature to handle the process
in-house. A popular, affordable option is to print on standard 8.5” x
11” Avery sticker label sheets using your printer. Simply load the
labels instead of plain paper, and your CRM can format and print them
accurately. If you print many labels, it’s worth investing in a
dedicated label printer, such as a Dymo LabelWriter, which is faster and
more convenient. For a professional appearance, you can also have your
CRM print addresses directly on your envelopes. This requires a printer
that supports envelope feeding, eliminating the need for stickers.

Another related service you can consider is a specialized direct-mail
service, such as YellowLetterHQ.com or YellowLetterShop.com, which
prepares and sends handwritten-looking letters on yellow, pink, or white
lined paper. This unique, eye-catching format is more likely to be
opened and read, making it highly effective for expired listings, FSBOs,
and estate sales. Your CRM can help you organize and export a CSV file
compatible with these services.

Direct mail has a distinct advantage: it has a greater impact than
email, helping you stand out amid digital clutter. Taking the time to
send a stamped letter sets you apart from other agents who send emails
without much thought. For FSBOs, expired listings, and probate leads,
mailing a physical letter may be the only way to reach these contacts. A
print strategy is a vital tool for prospecting and maintaining
relationships within your farm area and sphere of influence.

## Text Messaging

Text messaging has several advantages over other forms of communication.
Unlike a phone call, a text message does not require someone to answer
the phone to receive it. That means that even if they are at work, your
prospect will still be able to read and respond to your text message.
The open rate for text messages is far higher than for email, and text
messages are often read within minutes, whereas email is typically read
within a day or two of being sent.

Your real estate CRM can help you send text messages through a feature
called **text message chat**. It works just like sending a text on your
smartphone, but it offers several advantages over using your mobile
phone. Because you’re using the CRM on your computer, you can use your
keyboard and mouse, making messages faster to compose and send than from
your smartphone. You can also copy and paste template text and adjust it
as needed, producing higher-quality work with fewer typos. Because text
message chat is integrated into your CRM, you can see the full chat
transcript along with all your notes and contact information for
contacts and transactions. You can also include links to service reports
and other resources, such as photos, to communicate about your listings.

You can register a dedicated phone number for use with your CRM. This
number lets you send and receive texts, set up text message alerts, and
use your CRM's call capture feature. When you send a test message from
your CRM, it comes from that dedicated number. When someone replies to
one of your texts, the reply is sent back to your CRM, and a copy is
forwarded to your mobile phone as a text message. You would typically
choose a phone number with your local area code. You can even pick a
toll-free number if you prefer.

Just like with emails, there are federal rules and regulations you must
follow when sending business text messages. These rules are nuanced and
carry greater liability than sending an email without permission.
Enforcement is also much stricter due to the high level of traceability
for text messages and the limited number of US carriers (T-Mobile, AT&T,
Verizon).

The main rule concerns permission. If someone has given you permission
to send them text messages, you’re okay. However, unsolicited commercial
text messages are not allowed. Sometimes, permission must be in writing;
other times, consent can be implied. It depends on the type of message
you’re sending and how you're sending it.

The one area you should be cautious about is sending a solicitation text
message to someone you do not know and who is not expecting to hear from
you. For example, if you used a lead service to obtain FSBOs and expired
listings, those people did not ask to be contacted by a real estate
agent, so no permission, written or implied, was given. In that case,
your best approach is to call them, drive by, knock on the door, or send
a printed letter. A text message from a complete stranger is unlikely to
receive a positive response and violates federal consent rules.

Another thing to consider is whether your communications are personal
with someone you know. If that is the case, it is assumed you have
implied permission, and it is acceptable since the communication is
personal. For example, let’s say you wanted to send a quick text message
to a past client wishing them a happy birthday, that would be perfectly
acceptable. Another example is sending an informational message, such as
confirming an appointment date and time, to someone with whom you have
an ongoing business relationship. This is another example of implied
permission, and that would be considered OK.

The rules distinguish between business solicitation messages and other
types of texts. Business solicitations require the highest level of
permission: written consent. By contrast, personal messages require the
lowest level of permission, namely implied consent.

Prior written consent can be obtained in several ways. If someone texts
your call-capture phone number, you have implied written consent because
they initiated contact and you are replying to their inquiry. When
someone fills out the contact form on your website, you can obtain prior
written consent through the “terms of service” page. The communication
consent section of your “terms of service” clearly states that by
submitting their information, the user grants you and your agents
permission to contact them by phone, email, and text message. By
completing the contact form and clicking submit, the user also provides
prior written consent to receive recurring marketing and informational
messages via text. The user can revoke this consent at any time by
replying “STOP” to any text message or by using the unsubscribe link in
emails. In addition, you must include a statement to this effect on the
contact form page, with a consent checkbox linking to the terms of
service. The same rule applies to the open-house form in your CRM, where
a prospective buyer provides their phone number.

For web leads from third-party sites like Zillow, their terms of service
will include similar language. You should check with your lead service
about their specific terms and allowed messaging. They will be able to
clarify exactly what is permissible based on the method by which the
lead was obtained.

The compliance requirements are much stricter for automated text
messages, including time-release drip sequences and bulk campaigns. The
key difference is that permission to reply to an inquiry is not
considered the same as written permission to send an automated
time-release sequence of text messages. A simple checkbox on your
website would not be sufficient to enroll someone in an automated
text-messaging drip sequence.

Due to an increase in lawsuits over unsolicited texts and the high
liability of fines (up to $1,500 per message), most CRM vendors have
eliminated automated texting features. This change was necessary because
agents often lacked the required written consent for high-volume,
automated outreach, creating significant legal risks for both agents and
software providers.

Another rule you must follow is to include in your initial text message
an explanation of how someone can opt out of receiving text messages
from you. This is usually done by including a note in the first text
message that explains they can reply with “STOP” to stop receiving
messages. Your CRM automatically adds this phrase at the beginning of
any text message thread to ensure compliance with this rule.

Several industry practices are in place to align with the spirit of the
regulations. The primary goal is to reduce or eliminate unwanted text
messages. To send text messages in the United States, you must register
with the A2P 10DLC (Application-to-Person 10-Digit Long Code) system,
managed by a third party called The Campaign Registry (TCR). This is an
industry-wide requirement enforced by mobile carriers such as AT&T,
T-Mobile, and Verizon to combat spam and verify business communications.
Your CRM vendor can assist with the registration process. It involves
verifying that you are a legitimate business with a physical mailing
address and, ideally, a website with clear terms of service that permit
sending text messages. They will also ask for samples of the messages
you intend to send.

The registration process can take a few weeks, and it is important that
you provide as much complete information as possible. The purpose of the
application is to identify fraudulent or fake companies that send
malicious text message solicitations. I have found that using a
toll-free phone number requires slightly fewer documentation
requirements, as it is assumed that businesses that take the effort to
obtain one are less likely to be deceptive.

Failure to register will result in your messages being blocked or
filtered by carriers. Because there are very few carriers and the
registration process is very strict, I have found that without
registration, almost all the text messages you send will be blocked and
never received.

Canada has rules similar to those in the US, but they are slightly
stricter regarding implied consent. They also set a time limit on
consent—usually 6 months—that doesn’t exist in the US. Commercial
messages must also include your full contact information, typically via
a link to your website at the end of the message. Instructions for
unsubscribing should be included in every commercial text or via the
link. 

Like email, people can mark your text messages as spam. Mobile carriers
use automated systems to track these complaints and review your full
message history to determine whether your phone number should be
temporarily blacklisted. In serious cases, the company that sends your
messages, such as Twilio, might block your number while a review is in
progress. Because there are few carriers, they have significant
influence and can unilaterally block any phone number based on even a
single complaint.

For these reasons, text messages are useful when responding to an
inquiry from a prospect or client, following up with a past client, or
reaching out to someone in your sphere. However, they are not
appropriate for soliciting strangers to whom you have no permission to
text.

## In-Person

Face-to-face interaction remains the gold standard for communication. It
lets you present yourself in the best possible light and better
interpret your prospect’s feedback. Academic studies show that 50% to
90% of communication is nonverbal. When you meet someone in person, you
can observe body language cues, which makes you more convincing and
authoritative than you could be over the phone.

Some meetings, such as those at a coffee shop or a grocery store, happen
by chance. When meeting someone unexpectedly, the goal is to strengthen
the relationship. You can do this by gathering contact information and
sharing your business card. Unlike a phone call or an email, where
communication is ongoing, an in-person meeting does not automatically
provide an opportunity to follow up.

Another common form of direct contact is door-knocking, where you walk
through a neighborhood and introduce yourself. A good time to do this is
when you get a new listing in the area, before an open house, or after a
closing. You can mention the new listing and invite neighbors to view
the home. You can even ask if they know anyone who might be interested
in buying.

There are other situations where you know someone's address but have not
yet met them in person. This might be the case for an expired listing or
a For Sale By Owner (FSBO) listing. In those cases, knocking on the door
empty-handed might result in a slammed door. Instead, consider bringing
a valuable item, such as a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) or a
presentation packet you are delivering by hand. Offer something before
asking for something.

Other face-to-face meetings are carefully scheduled appointments, such
as a listing presentation, an offer presentation, or a meeting to
prepare an offer. In each case, you should prepare in advance. By using
cloud file storage integrated with your CRM, you can always have your
contracts ready for signature. You also need to anticipate common
questions and objections. Additionally, have a clear goal for these
meetings. What exactly do you want to accomplish before the meeting
ends?

While new agents spend much of their time trying to get in front of
prospects, experienced agents can face the opposite problem. It is easy
to become overwhelmed with meetings. You can only meet so many people in
person while maintaining the high level of professionalism you pride
yourself on. To address this dilemma, several strategies are available.
Listing appointments are typically held at the listed home. However,
other appointments, such as offer presentations, can be conducted in
your office. This approach can allow you to schedule multiple
appointments back-to-back and reduce your commute time. You can use your
real estate CRM’s calendar to keep track of your commitments and their
locations. Additionally, your smartphone can account for travel time
between appointments and remind you when to leave one place to arrive at
the next.

While traditional face-to-face meetings are a hallmark of the real
estate industry, you can leverage technology to expand your business
beyond the limits of physical presence. This includes virtual
consultations and tours. Successful growth also often involves
delegation and team building. You can hire administrative staff to
handle paperwork and transaction coordinators to manage deal flow. You
can also utilize buyer’s agents to conduct in-person showings.
Maintaining a balanced approach that includes in-person meetings lets
you maximize the advantages of direct contact while reducing the
inefficiencies that can come with relying solely on face-to-face
interactions.

## Special Occasions

> “Choose a reasonable number of people to actually speak with by phone
> or in person daily from your database. Five or fewer is recommended,
> though you’ll need to dial a larger number to make those five real
> contacts.”

—Tim & Julie Harris, *Harris Rules*

A surprising statistic is that only 9% of realtors consistently stay in
touch with clients after closing[40]. Your past clients are your best
opportunities for referrals and repeat business. The longer you are in
the industry, the more you can draw on the extensive goodwill you have
built with your satisfied past clients.

Many agents are unsure how to transition from a strictly professional
relationship to a trusted friend and advisor after closing. This chapter
shows how to turn everyday moments into opportunities to stay in touch
and build friendships. First, you’ll learn how regular contact fosters
loyalty and encourages repeat business. Next, you’ll discover how
personal events and holidays help you stay connected with current and
former clients. Finally, you’ll see how to use your CRM to plan and
follow through consistently. By following these steps, you’ll create a
steady flow of communication that keeps you top of mind. When your
friends need good real estate advice, you’ll always be there for them.
And remember—you are never too busy for their referrals!

## Christmas Cards

Sending Christmas cards through the postal mail is one of the most
effective ways to connect with people in your sphere of influence.
Christmas cards make a meaningful impact for a small investment. The
value of these cards goes beyond politeness; they leverage a powerful
psychological principle. In 1974, sociologist Phillip Kunz sent about
600 Christmas cards to strangers, and nearly 200 people responded, many
with personal notes and family photos. Some continued sending cards for
over 15 years. This reaction was due to what social scientists call the
norm of reciprocity. When someone does something for us, we feel
compelled to return the favor. Dr. Robert Cialdini later identified
reciprocity as one of the six universal principles of influence in his
seminal book *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion*. For real estate
professionals, the message is clear: Christmas cards are special. They
help build lasting relationships, strengthen trust, and keep you top of
mind with clients and your network over the long term.


The best way to start is to create a “Christmas” category in your
contacts list and add everyone you’d like to send a Christmas card to.
The annual review of your Christmas list is a great opportunity to tidy
up your database.

If you’re hesitant to send a card to someone, they probably don’t belong
in your database. Your CRM can filter your contact database to show
contacts without a mailing address. That way, you can call these people
and gather their mailing addresses. This is a great reason to make a
quick call to check in. You never know, they might just need your
services or know someone who needs a trusted agent. It’s the ideal time
of year to reconnect with old friends, distant family, and past clients.

While I use the term Christmas, you can send winter holiday cards if you
prefer to keep your holiday greetings neutral. Suppose a large part of
your database is non-Christian. In that case, you might also create a
second category, “WinterHoliday,” and send one card to the “Christmas”
group and a different one to your “WinterHoliday” group.

There’s something special about Christmas cards[41]. People love
receiving them and display them prominently where guests are likely to
see them. Go all out with glitter and bling. No other medium lets you
send a piece of mail that recipients proudly display for others to see.
Do it tastefully, and your card becomes free advertising that can
inspire a referral. For this to work, commit fully to the season. The
more beautiful and festive the card, the better. Avoid turning it into a
marketing piece with your face on the cover. This isn’t a Bud Light ad.
It’s your heartfelt wish for the recipient to enjoy a wonderful holiday.

In many ways, your role as a real estate agent is to help people find
their perfect home. ‘Home’ is created when people make space for each
other in their hearts. It’s about being with loved ones who matter most
and feeling accepted. For many, Christmas is the one time of year when
scattered family and friends come together intentionally. A house is
more than just an address — it’s the foundation of tradition, a refuge
for comfort, and the main stage where shared moments become lasting
legacies.

Your CRM can help you organize and print mailing labels when it’s time
to send cards. Use the “Christmas” category you created. You can even
print directly on the envelopes if you prefer.

Don’t diminish the experience with generic salutations like “Current
Resident” or “To Whom It May Concern.” That language disrespects the
holiday and the sentiment. Address your card to the household, not just
an individual. When you add the spouse field to each contact record,
your real estate CRM can address envelopes like this: “Jack and Cindy
Smith.” A generic CRM will not get this right. It may produce something
like “Jack Smith, Engineer, Apple Computer,” which looks too
businesslike. A generic tool may even send a separate Christmas card to
each family member, undermining the idea of a family. A real estate
specific CRM will excel here.


> **The Postal Prowess Secret:** Use your annual Christmas card mailing to update your address book. Use your CRM to print “Address Service Requested” on your envelopes. That way, if a past client has moved, the post office will forward you the card and send you their new address. This helps you discover when a client has moved.


When sending your card, use First-Class stamps and include your return
address. The postal service allows you to add an endorsement, or
directive, to your envelope. If you add a note, “Return Service
Requested,” to your card, it will not be forwarded if someone moves;
instead, it will be returned to you with the new address. This is useful
because the default for First-Class is to forward for a period of time,
typically six months. The endorsement “Address Service Requested” works
a bit differently. It allows you to forward email while still receiving
notifications. Choose the option that best matches your goal: either to
force returns or to enable forwarding with updates.

Removing invalid addresses is an effective way to update your contact
list and clean your database. If someone moved without your help,
consider removing them from your database. Some people will also send
you cards. Check the return addresses on the cards you receive to see if
anyone has moved, especially out of state or out of the city where you
operate. That is an excellent second way to update physical mailing
addresses each year around the holidays.

A second effective strategy is to send “thank you” cards by postal mail.
Order several hundred thank-you cards with envelopes from a print shop.
You can add personal notes and send them as a “thank you” whenever you
connect with someone. This is an excellent way to show you care and are
willing to put in a little extra effort to recognize others. The impact
of handwritten notes sent by postal mail should not be underestimated.
They offer an old-world charm that email cannot replicate. Greeting
cards build goodwill and make recipients happy when they receive one. It
is also another way to maintain the accuracy of your address book.

Some third-party services send physical greeting cards on your behalf.
Well-known options include SendOutCards and Sendsations. If you choose
one of these platforms, use your real estate CRM’s export features to
generate a mailing list of names, addresses, and birthdays, ready to
upload to these greeting card services. Then you can automatically
arrange for birthday cards to be sent on the correct date.

## Birthdays

While Christmas cards are the most common greeting cards, you should
also consider sending birthday cards. Who doesn’t like getting a
greeting card in the mail that wishes them a happy birthday? This is
another perfect opportunity to say “hi” to someone you know. Your real
estate CRM can print mailing labels for birthday cards and track who
you’ve sent them to. Birthday cards are also yet another opportunity to
find out if someone has moved.


> **The Birthday Bank Secret:** A birthday call is a great reason to reconnect with past clients. Eventually, when the time is right, they’ll contact you for business because showed that you care. You are their friend who also happens to be a real estate agent.


Remembering a client’s birthday is a good reason to call. The main goal
isn’t just to send a greeting; it’s to use the occasion as a sincere
reason for a friendly chat. These conversations show you care and may
also reveal important life events. For example, if a client mentions
they’re turning 65, it may subtly suggest they’re thinking about
retirement and moving to a warmer place. Such talks may also uncover
other life events, such as a promotion, a new baby, or a desire to
downsize — all of which could require your services.

### Lance Lubin

In St. Petersburg, Florida, Lance Lubin, co-owner of Team Realty, has
built a business on a tradition everyone celebrates annually. For more
than two decades, Lance and his wife, MJ, have sent birthday cards and
personally called each client to sing “Happy Birthday.” Lance is a
barbershop quartet singer, so it came naturally to use his voice as a
gift. The client’s birthday songs began as a thoughtful gesture and
quickly became their signature touch. “It’s sad but amazing how many
people tell us we’re the only ones who called them that day—even before
their own kids,” Lance says. Using their CRM, the team tracks every
client’s birthday. Their assistant handles scheduling, but Lance and MJ
always make the calls themselves, which gives them a good pretext to
strike up a conversation after their song. Lance says he draws on Dale
Carnegie’s FORD method—Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams—during
these conversations. Over the years, clients have come to eagerly
anticipate their serenade; one even answers the phone with, “Start
singing!” By using his talent and the consistency of his CRM to track
birthdays, Lance and his wife can call every client every year.

—«◊»—

There are many ways to reach out. A handwritten card is a charming,
tangible gesture people appreciate. A text message is effective because
of its high open rate, but it requires careful handling. Sending a
simple “Happy Birthday!” text is a missed opportunity. To make it more
meaningful, consider adding an open-ended question that invites a reply,
such as “How have you been?” This transforms a basic greeting into the
start of a conversation. You can also send birthday wishes through
social media platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn. This method offers
many of the same conversational benefits as a text message and is
another excellent way to stay connected.

You can buy birthday cards in bulk at your local dollar store. The cost
of sending birthday cards to friends, relatives, and past clients is low
and helps build goodwill with those you know, increasing the likelihood
of referrals and repeat business. You can expect to receive at least one
listing each year from this effort, which provides a great return on
investment.

Some real estate CRMs include an eCard library with birthday eCards you
can send via email. These are a convenient option for contacts without
physical addresses. They’re quick to send and cost nothing extra. While
eCards are helpful, I still feel that a physical greeting card sent by
mail makes a more lasting impression.

A phone call remains the best way to wish someone a happy birthday
because it allows for real interaction. It’s the only method that
enables a spontaneous, back-and-forth conversation where you can truly
listen and connect. Even if your call goes to voicemail, the effort to
reach out personally means a lot. For your most important past clients
and referrers, consider pairing a personal phone call with a handwritten
card for maximum impact. If there’s one day of the year to call someone,
it’s definitely to wish them a happy birthday.

Ultimately, whichever method you choose, the key principles for your
birthday outreach are consistency, timeliness, and a personal touch.
Your CRM helps ensure you stay on schedule and consistent, but it is
your genuine effort to connect as a friend that builds trust and leads
to future business.

## Closing Anniversaries

The purchase of a home is a major milestone for your client. For a real
estate agent, the anniversary of that purchase is a great opportunity to
reconnect with past buyers and see how they are doing. It’s a personal
reminder of the important life event you helped facilitate, and it’s a
perfect moment to reaffirm your role as their lifelong real estate
advisor.

Use your CRM to remind you each year of the anniversary of every closing
you have participated in. You can also use your CRM to send an
anniversary eCard from your CRM’s content library. I have found that the
best way to acknowledge this day is with a personal visit. Consider
stopping by with a small, thoughtful gift, such as a bottle of wine or
tulip bulbs for your buyer’s garden. Spend time with your buyer and let
them show you all the improvements they have made over the past year.
Letting them showcase their new landscaping or fresh paint keeps you top
of mind.

This visit is also a great opportunity to add real value, such as
bringing an informal CMA to show how their investment has increased in
value. If the home has appreciated considerably, it might be enough to
eliminate the need to pay Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI), which
lenders require for conventional loans when the buyer’s down payment is
less than 20 percent of the purchase price. You might also be able to
provide contractor recommendations for someone considering a remodeling
project. Sharing your industry connections offers long-term value.

Finally, remember to “adopt” the buyer from any transaction where you
represented the seller. Their agent has likely forgotten them, giving
you a perfect opportunity to stay in touch.

## Baby Shower

Why would you volunteer to organize and host a baby shower? It’s a nice
way to show your friendship to the mom-to-be. You also have the chance
to meet the mother’s friends in a social setting. You can use your CRM
to collect contact information, since you’ll need to send invitations to
everyone. You can print mailing labels, send a bulk email invitation,
and follow up with a reminder email right before the event. Offering to
organize a baby shower is a valuable opportunity to expand your network.


> **Stork Sign Secret:** After the baby is born, offer to put up a celebratory stork sign in your friend’s front yard. This thoughtful, public gesture is a great way to celebrate a milestone and demonstrate to the neighborhood that you are a caring, community-minded agent.


The expectant mother might need more space for her family. Is their
current place large enough to accommodate the new baby? Additionally,
they may be thinking ahead and considering that the school district they
live in might not be the best fit. There are many reasons someone
expecting a child might consider moving.

## Client Appreciation Events

As you become a more established real estate agent, your referral
network will grow. Hosting client appreciation events is one of the most
popular and effective ways to thank people for referrals and repeat
business. A client appreciation event is a gathering, party, or activity
you host for your contacts in your sphere of influence (SOI). From the
attendees’ perspective, the main goal is to show your continued
appreciation for the referrals and repeat business your friends have
brought your way over the past year.

Client events aren’t just for past clients; you should invite everyone
in your SOI. The easiest way to decide who to include is to ask: would
they recognize your name and accept a friend request if you sent one on
Facebook? If the answer is yes, they are a good candidate for an
invitation to your next client appreciation event. Generally, you should
be as inclusive as possible to maximize your benefit from these events.


These events can take many forms, from simple, low-cost gestures to more
elaborate gatherings. Many agents host a “Thanksgiving Pie Giveaway,”
where clients stop by the office to pick up a free pie. Family-friendly
seasonal events are also popular. You could host a “Pumpkin Patch” in
the fall with hay bales and a photographer, or hold “Photos with Santa”
right before Christmas. Other popular options include hosting a wine or
craft beer tasting, organizing an outdoor picnic or ice cream social, or
planning a group outing to a local sports game. You could also run a DIY
home improvement workshop or a financial planning seminar to add
educational value and position yourself as a local expert. Choose an
activity that promotes interaction. An event overly focused on the
activity itself, such as a movie or a theater performance, may limit
your ability to interact one-on-one with attendees. The possibilities
are endless, and once you start using your creativity, you are certain
to come up with many ways to show your appreciation.

### Chris Warhurst

In the sunny, scenic community of St. George, Utah, Realtor Chris
Warhurst has discovered a simple but powerful way to show appreciation:
pumpkin pies. Every year, Chris hosts her “Thanksgiving Pie Giveaway”,
where she invites past clients to stop by her downtown office before the
holiday and pick up a freshly baked pumpkin pie. “It’s a small gesture,
but it shows my clients how much I appreciate them,” Chris says. Each
year, she gives out more than 100 pies to her clients. This gesture has
turned into an annual tradition that all her past clients look forward
to. Behind the scenes, Chris uses her CRM to send personalized
invitations through bulk email, track RSVPs, and follow up after the
event. She says, “It’s important to keep my database organized, so I
don’t forget anyone, or else I’ll be stuck eating a lot of pies.”
Chris’s dedication to each of her clients extends beyond holiday
festivities. She provides each client with a Closing Binder containing
contracts, appraisals, utility details, and inspection reports.

Additionally, nearly every transaction includes a home warranty,
providing clients peace of mind after closing. “I want my clients to
feel supported at every step,” she says. “I always want to be giving my
clients an experience they want to remember.” In a market as vibrant and
competitive as St. George, surrounded by red rock landscapes, Chris
stands out through her big and small heartfelt gestures.

For your attendees, the main goal of these events is to give you a
chance to say thank you. For you, the key benefit is that it solves one
of your biggest problems: how to stay in touch with your SOI without
feeling like a “salesperson.” Many agents don’t keep in touch with past
clients because they don’t want to constantly ask for referrals. The
last thing you want is for people to cross the street when they see you,
fearing a sales pitch. An event addresses this dilemma by giving you a
compelling, non-salesy reason to connect with your SOI. You’re calling
to invite someone to a party! This way, you give rather than ask. That
is a much more powerful position from a referral standpoint. By giving
first, you activate the principle of reciprocity. People in your network
are much more likely to recommend your services in return and to express
appreciation for your invitation. They don’t even need to attend your
event for you to benefit from the rule of reciprocity.

Many agents think the main goal of a client appreciation event is the
event itself, but that’s not accurate. The primary purpose is to help
you connect with everyone in your network. When done well, a single
client appreciation event allows you to reach each person multiple times
over one or two months. Think of the event as a powerful social tool for
staying in touch without feeling awkward. If you had chosen not to host
a client appreciation event and instead called everyone in your SOI
every 90 days to say “hi,” the conversations might be more awkward, and
you’d be less likely to build genuine connections. Your calls could even
be seen as self-serving. But with an event, you have a reason to call
them, send an email reminder, mail a printed invitation, and maybe even
text them. That’s at least four touches per event. This helps you stay
top of mind with the people who know you, so if they or someone they
know needs a real estate agent during that time, your name is more
likely to come to mind.

While many agents host just one event in the fall or late winter, you
should consider offering three or even four each year. Why? Because the
typical lead incubation cycle for referrals lasts about 90 days. So, by
the time you’ve followed up on the referrals from one client
appreciation event, you’re ready to attend the next. There are many
types of appreciation events you can plan, and you should consider a
variety throughout the year. This will eliminate any concerns about
party fatigue for you or the attendees.

Most common events follow a “come-and-go” format. This setup lets
attendees arrive and leave at their convenience within a set timeframe,
rather than requiring everyone to be present at once. The “Pumpkin
Patch,” “Photos with Santa,” and “Thanksgiving Pie Giveaway” are great
examples of this relaxed approach. The main benefit is that this style
is very low-risk and reduces stress for you as the host. Unlike a formal
“sit-down” dinner, which can be costly and risky if attendance is low, a
come-and-go event remains successful even with sporadic attendance
because guests arrive at different times. This method not only cuts
costs and stress but also provides more convenience for your clients,
who will appreciate the flexibility.

Another option is to support or adopt an existing event rather than
create your own. You can sponsor a local sports team, promote a
community event like a bake sale at a nearby school, collaborate with a
local hospital on a blood drive, or organize a canned food drive. Be
sure to contact the organization and obtain permission before promoting
the event on its behalf. For example, if you are known as an agent who
cares about pets, you could sponsor a pet adoption day where the local
animal shelter brings in adoptable animals. You could promote this event
on the back of your real estate flyers and to your sphere of influence.
What makes this a particularly compelling cause is that many people
looking to adopt a pet are also inclined to appreciate homeownership,
where their pet would be most comfortable. So, you are not only doing a
good deed and engaging your sphere of influence through communication,
but you are also aligning yourself with a pro-home cause.

You could also support a local business by offering a promotional coupon
or ticket, such as a free ice cream at a nearby shop or a complimentary
drink at a local bar during a designated happy hour for your community.
These events build community. They also let you align with good causes
and are particularly valuable if you are personally aligned with a
specific charity or cause.

Planning for these events should be done several months in advance.
First, you need to decide what you will be doing and when. Some events,
such as outdoor picnics, should be held when the weather is suitable.
Other events, such as a pie giveaway, are typically held around
Christmas and Thanksgiving.

Next, identify who will co-sponsor the event with you. Review your
closings from the past year to identify which parties were involved in
each transaction, including loan officers, home inspectors, insurance
agents, title companies, and others. These are the people who also
benefit when you close a deal. Use your CRM’s referral-tracking feature
to find out who would gain the most from you doing more business.
Usually, a single additional closing is enough to justify co-sponsoring
an event with you. Contact these individuals and ask for a commitment to
help cover the costs. Also ask whether they will assist in promoting the
event by reaching out to their sphere of influence. The more attendees,
the better, and this is definitely a “you scratch my back, and I’ll
scratch yours” situation.

You should also consider reaching out to local businesses as sponsors.
For example, if you plan to host an event at the local brewery, contact
the owner to discuss arrangements. You could cover the cost of the first
two drinks by creating a coupon the bartender would accept. You would
then pay based on the number of coupons redeemed. Since you are
promoting their business, you could request a discount on your fee in
exchange for Facebook promotion or a few Google reviews. This is an
excellent way to support a local business while also providing a venue
for your event.

Hiring a professional photographer for your key events is a highly
effective strategy that serves two main purposes. First, it provides a
steady stream of high-quality, professional content for your social
media marketing, showcasing your successful, well-attended events.
Second, it offers a valuable, tangible gift to your clients. This
approach works especially well for family-friendly events—such as photos
with Santa or the Easter Bunny—or for formal galas where clients would
appreciate a professional portrait. The “Mastery” strategy involves
partnering with the photographer. You can pay a flat fee for the
photographer’s time and, in return, offer one or two free digital images
to each guest. The photographer can then generate additional revenue by
upselling larger photo packages and providing prints directly to your
clients, which can often help lower your upfront costs.

If you haven’t already, create a category named “AppreciationParty” in
your CRM to represent who you will be inviting. It may be best to create
multiple categories, with each representing a block of 500 people you
plan to invite. For example, the first 500 people would be in the
category “AppreciationParty1”, the second in “AppreciationParty2”, and
so on. By breaking your invitee list into blocks of 500, you can send
bulk emails, print mailing labels, and make follow-up calls more easily.

Next, create your party invitation. The easiest and most practical
approach is to design a single image that includes all the details of
your event. It should include the date, location, your contact
information, branding, and the sponsor’s name. A good way to do this is
to use Canva and an AI tool like Google’s Gemini. You want something
that looks visually appealing and inviting. The image should work well
for email, text messages, Facebook posts, and printing as a postcard or
envelope insert. This one image will be the centerpiece of your
invitation strategy. Once you’ve created invitations for one or two
events, you can use them as templates for future invitations. While your
first few may take some time to create, they will become much quicker
with practice.

Next, you should create a task plan in your CRM—a checklist of
activities you will carry out to ensure your party runs smoothly. You
should allow at least 1 month, and preferably 2 months, of lead time
before the party to fully implement your plan. You can use a similar
checklist for each of your events, though each will have slight
differences, such as confirming the venue and coordinating food and
drink logistics.

With your party invitation and invitee list ready, send a bulk “save the
date” email to everyone through your CRM. This isn’t a formal
invitation, just a heads-up about the event so people know something’s
coming. It also kicks off your phone campaign. Start calling everyone in
your network to inform them about the upcoming event. Pace yourself—aim
to make just 5 or 10 calls each day. Use the last contact date in your
CRM to track who you’ve reached and who still needs a call. If you’re
already calling and visiting people for birthday greetings or home
anniversary wishes, you can naturally also mention the event and save
time.

The best way to handle your contact strategy is to call everyone; if
they don’t answer, leave a voicemail. Let them know a party invitation
is on its way. They don’t need to attend or RSVP, but if they can, you’d
love to see them there. If you leave a voicemail, you can also send a
text message with the invitation image. If you reach them by phone, it’s
a great opportunity to start a conversation. If they can’t make the
party, that’s okay. You still had the chance to talk with them, and they
still feel appreciated. You still achieved your main goal: to touch
everyone on your SOI every 90 days in a way that isn’t irritating.

You may not have mailing addresses for a few people. Take the
opportunity to collect that information in your CRM while you are on the
phone. You should send a printed invitation by postal mail a few weeks
before the event. Many people prefer a physical invitation because it
serves as a reminder they can set aside. You can use the envelope
printing and mailing-label features in your real estate CRM to organize
your mailing. You will also want to send a bulk email invitation to
everyone in your real estate CRM.

Your social media strategy should include several posts on Facebook and
other platforms, such as X and LinkedIn. The first is a save-the-date
post, followed by the invitation, which you should post a few times.
After the event, share photos to demonstrate its success and that
everyone had a great time. You can also use Facebook to communicate with
people via Direct Messaging (DM) with whom you do not have another way
to connect.

If you prefer to use a third-party mailing service to send your email
invitations or to print and mail your invitations, you can export your
mailing list from your CRM. Many postcard companies can print and mail
your invitations at a reasonable cost. There are also third-party
services that handle sending party invitations via email, such as Evite,
Paperless Post, and Punchbowl. These services offer several advantages
over using your CRM, especially if you want to automate sending initial
invitations, follow-up reminders, text message reminders, and
automatically track RSVPs.

At the event, you’ll want a way to track attendees. You can repurpose
your CRM’s open house form or call capture feature as a digital sign-in.
Some events will naturally require registration, such as a pie giveaway
or ticket distribution for drinks. For more free-flowing events, you can
run a raffle to boost registration. Choose one or more registered
participants to win a prize, such as a gift card to a local restaurant.
If your event is time-limited, consider hiring a greeter so you can
mingle with guests and build relationships rather than being stuck at
the door.

These events are also an opportunity to ask attendees for something. For
example, you could hire a videographer to record live testimonials from
clients about how well you have helped them buy or sell real estate. You
could then post those videos on social media.

Your post-event strategy is where the most valuable final actions take
place. Within 48 hours, send a thank-you email to all attendees, which
your CRM can automate using the attendance log you created. More
importantly, update the last contact date for everyone who attended and
add notes on their attendance and any conversations you had with them,
especially regarding potential referrals. You should immediately follow
up with calls to anyone who mentioned needing your services or provided
a referral at the event.

Your final step is to use social media to boost your event’s success.
Share an album with photos from the event and tag every attendee. This
is a great way to keep your special post visible longer, while everyone
you’ve tagged sees it — and so do all their friends — showcasing how you
give back and strengthening your role as a connected community leader.
This is especially helpful for events with a charity component, as it
gives you a positive halo effect from being associated with a good deed.

After hosting a few events like this, you can also use advanced
strategies to boost the success of your client appreciation events. You
might turn a high-end listing’s open house into a family-friendly block
party. Bring in a bouncy house, hire a face painter, and bring a Taco
Truck to serve free food for visitors. Such an event creates a
family-friendly vibe that highlights neighborly connections and could
even help sell the house in just one weekend. It’s impactful and unique,
helping you stand out from the competition.

A client appreciation event is a powerful strategic tool. Its main
purpose is to turn your social capital—the trust and relationships
you’ve built—into economic capital through referrals. Academic research
shows that referred clients are more valuable, with higher profit
margins and lower churn rates than clients acquired through other
channels. This research also identified a process called “better
matching,” which shows that your most profitable referrals come from
your most experienced, high-value clients. These “Top100” clients
already understand your professional value and are well-suited to your
business. They are uniquely positioned to evaluate their social networks
and identify prospects who fit financially and personally. That is why
you should focus your best efforts on activating these specific,
high-value referrers.

While most events should be for your entire Sphere of Influence (SOI),
you can use your CRM’s categories to organize smaller, more exclusive
events for your “Top100” list. This offers a high-value reward for your
most important contacts and complements the regular 90-day follow-up
calls you already make to this group. Examples include an “adults-only”
happy hour, a “Moms and Mimosas” breakfast, or tickets to a ball game.
This segmentation is smart because it reduces the risk of planning a
“sit-down” event for your entire database. It also conveys a sense of
exclusivity to your Top100 list, giving them clear evidence that you
especially appreciate all they do.

If unfamiliar people, such as neighbors at a community event, show up,
see it as an opportunity to meet new people. Your main goal is to
connect with others. Introduce yourself, give them your business card,
collect their info for the raffle, and treat each new person as an
opportunity to find your next client. You might also ask attendees to
bring a friend — and, of course, the whole family. The more, the merrier
when it comes to client appreciation events.

This is especially useful if you are targeting a specific geographic
farm neighborhood. You can host events at the local clubhouse or sponsor
a community garage sale. This lets you meet the neighbors, add them to
your database, and capture their contact information in your CRM.


You can also host personalized events where you visit your sphere of
influence and deliver something. Halloween marks the end of fall and the
start of winter, as well as the beginning of the holiday season. This is
an ideal time for a neighborhood door-to-door campaign. Buy a few dozen
small pumpkins and grab a small red wagon. Attach your business card to
each pumpkin with a ribbon or a toothpick, then walk your geographic
farm, handing out pumpkins. Take time to stop and chat with neighbors.
This is a great way to connect with your community. If you had a few
listings in that neighborhood last season, you can share the news about
the new neighbors.

You can track the success of your events using your CRM’s
referral-tracking features. A good goal is for each event to generate at
least one referral or repeat client. Use this data to identify your
“most fertile” contacts and update your “Top100” category list each
year. You should also use the flurry of communications you have sent to
maintain the accuracy of your contacts database. Some postal mail will
be returned as people have moved. Call those people and confirm their
new address. For email addresses that have bounced, reach out by phone
to obtain their latest email address. A change in mailing address, email
address, or phone number could indicate that the person has moved, and
that is something worth discussing when you speak with them over the
phone. If you do not plan to update this information for anyone, add the
“Cold” category to them so they can be removed from your Contacts
database at the end of the year.

Treat an appreciation event as a repeatable system rather than a
one-time celebration. This means establishing a clear process, from
initial planning and budgeting through event logistics to, most
importantly, post-event evaluation. This system lays the groundwork for
consistent planning. The real power of this approach is that it helps
you stay regularly in touch with your Sphere of Influence (SOI) without
coming across as an annoying salesperson. 

This event-based system is especially important for agents with a large,
established SOI. As your sphere expands, leveraging mass events such as
client appreciation gatherings becomes the most efficient way to
maintain contact with people. Your CRM enables efficient management of
this large-scale, “mass-personal” communication through task plans for
promotions, bulk emails for invitations, and segmentation categories. It
provides a single, powerful reason to connect systematically with every
person in your database, ensuring no one is overlooked.

Ultimately, client appreciation events are the most effective and
enjoyable way to activate your database. They give back to your
community, build strong social proof of your success, and create a
low-pressure environment for requesting reviews and referrals. By using
your CRM to organize, promote, track, and follow up, you are building a
repeatable, predictable system that generates long-term loyalty and
referrals, fueling your business for years to come.
