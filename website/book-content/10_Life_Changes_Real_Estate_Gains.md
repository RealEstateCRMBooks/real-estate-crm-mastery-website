—Jennifer Allan, *Sell with Soul*

Very few people buy or sell a home on a whim. Almost every real estate
transaction is driven by a major life event: marriage, a new baby, a job
change, divorce, or retirement. These are not just personal milestones;
they are the primary reasons why someone buys or sells real estate. An
experienced agent understands this and recognizes that their role is to
support people through life’s biggest, most emotional changes.


By paying attention to these events, you shift from reactive to
proactive, helping you anticipate when a friend or relative might need
your help. When you recognize these signs, you might even foresee the
need for your assistance before your friend is aware of it themselves.
Your friends will appreciate your professional advice because they know
you have their best interests at heart and that you will do everything
possible to maximize their return on the sale or purchase of their home.


> **Baby on Board Secret:** When someone shares that they are having a new baby, that’s a sign that they might need your assistance soon. One of the most common reasons why someone might want to upsize their home is that they have a growing family and need more space.


The following sections examine the most common life events that prompt a
move. We discuss each situation in detail and suggest ways to connect
with your clients and prospects during these critical, often emotional
moments. These are just a few examples. Once you understand the main
idea, you’ll develop an intuitive sense of which friends will soon need
the help of a trusted real estate agent. This enables you to spend more
time and focus intentionally on those friends during these key
milestones in their lives.

## Marriage

When a couple gets married, one of their first considerations is usually
where to live. Are they already living together, or will they move in
together after getting married? They may be renting and are looking for
a more stable option, such as buying a home. If that’s the case, you
might be asked for advice on how they can become new homebuyers. There
are many questions to consider, such as how much of a down payment is
needed and which neighborhoods are good for raising a family.

According to a study by Colwell Banker, approximately 35% of all married
couples buy their first home together by their second wedding
anniversary. With that in mind, a newly married couple has a 1-in-3
chance of needing your services within the next two years. You should
maintain regular contact with anyone you know who is engaged or recently
married. The best way to do that is to add them to a touch cycle in your
CRM so you can follow up with them every 90 days. Strengthen your
friendship so you can be the agent they turn to when they need a real
estate professional.

Typically, the bride will be more aware of the benefits of buying a home
than the husband-to-be. Because of this, you might consider visiting
bridal shows. You can meet with brides and hold seminars on the
home-buying process. You can explain the importance of a good credit
score, the down payment that might be needed, and run maximum loan
calculations for brides to see what types of homes they can afford.

You could partner with bridal show vendors and exchange mailing lists.
You might host a raffle where participants enter by sharing their
contact information. One easy way to gather this info at a bridal show
is to use your real estate CRM’s call capture feature. Brides can text a
3-digit code to your call capture phone number, which records their
phone number and caller ID name. You can ask them to text a specific
detail related to the raffle, such as how many jellybeans are in the
jar. The winner receives a $100 gift card or free tickets to a local
“Street of Dreams” event. Call capture creates prospect records in your
CRM, so you can follow up with calls and texts to help the newlywed
couple on their journey toward homeownership.

Newly engaged couples likely have not yet purchased a home, so they may
benefit from information on the home-buying process, how to get
pre-qualified for a home loan, and how to check their credit scores and
address any blemishes on their credit record. You can provide general
advice, but it is beneficial to partner with a loan officer when you go
to bridal shows. The benefits of having a team comprised of a real
estate agent and a mortgage broker become especially clear when working
with new homebuyers who have no experience in the process and don’t even
know where to start.


> **Bride’s Buddy Secret:** Marriage often triggers a couple’s first serious consideration of homeownership. By attending bridal shows and offering educational seminars like a “Home Buying for Couples”, you can connect with engaged couples early, provide practical advice, and capture their contact information for follow-up. This positions you as a knowledgeable, trustworthy resource for newlyweds and first-time homebuyers.


The period between a wedding and a couple’s second anniversary is the
most critical and responsive window for turning newlyweds into active
homebuyers. This is known as the “nesting phase,” a psychological and
practical stage that typically occurs in the first few years of
marriage, during which the couple focuses on building their shared life
and home. It involves moving beyond the initial excitement of the
“honeymoon phase” to establish a deeper sense of safety, comfort, and
permanence in their new life together. This transition often manifests
as a practical need to purchase a stable home before starting a family.

While buying a home together is an exciting milestone, newlyweds should
first understand that money can be a major source of marital conflict
and stress. The home-buying process requires couples to confront and
align their financial goals, credit histories, and spending habits. The
essential first step is for the couple to achieve financial clarity and
organization. You could host a “Financial Fitness for Future Homeowners”
seminar in partnership with a loan officer. This event would guide the
couple toward financial alignment by discussing and agreeing on savings
goals, consolidating or paying down debt, and resolving credit report
issues. You can use the maximum loan calculator in your real estate CRM
to demonstrate how current debt affects borrowing power, and the
rent-vs-own calculator can be used to demonstrate the tax and
appreciation benefits of ownership over renting.

During the nesting phase, newlyweds might engage in “window shopping”
for a home without feeling pressured to commit. You can leverage this
inclination by hosting a “Designing Your Dream Future Home” seminar to
help the couple begin visualizing their shared future. The seminar would
cover neighborhoods and schools, and discuss the pros and cons of
specific home features. You can also explain how commute times might
influence their decision. This low-pressure event encourages the couple
to dream together, fostering an emotional connection to homeownership
while positioning you as the key partner in turning that dream into
reality.

Beyond the seminar, you can use your MLS listing alerts to support the
couple’s “window shopping.” Set up a weekly email alert based on their
ideal home criteria, such as neighborhoods, price, and features. Explain
that these alerts are for informational purposes only and that the
couple should not feel obligated to act on them. This helps your
newlywed couple visualize homeownership and identify target
neighborhoods and preferred home types.

To harness the aspirational energy of the nesting phase, encourage
engaged couples to create a Dream Board—either physically or
digitally—on platforms like Pinterest. This activity turns their
abstract dreams into clear visuals. Suggest that the couple fill their
board with magazine photos or pins of ideal home styles (such as Modern
Farmhouse or Mid-Century Modern), specific design features (like kitchen
layouts or backyard landscaping), and home decor ideas. This is a
valuable tool for you as well. When meeting with the couple, ask them to
share their Pinterest board. Analyzing their pins gives you a clear
understanding of their preferences, allowing you to set up highly
targeted listing alerts and guide them toward the perfect neighborhood,
home style, and features when they’re ready to buy.

There are many intangible benefits of homeownership that a newly married
couple might not yet appreciate. You can highlight the extra freedoms
and space a home offers: the ability to adopt a pet without landlord
restrictions, the peace of mind that comes from not hearing neighbors
above or below, and the luxury of dedicated space for new hobbies. For
instance, a home can provide a garage for a partner who wants a workshop
for car maintenance or woodworking, or a fenced yard and garden beds for
a couple interested in gardening or landscaping. This is just one more
way you can help a newly married couple imagine themselves as
homeowners.

Prospecting newly engaged couples can be very rewarding, both
financially and emotionally. You’re helping a couple who have fallen in
love find their forever home together. However, you need to be realistic
about the multi-year commitment required to nurture these kinds of
leads. You might meet someone today, but not close on their home for
another two years.

## Job Changes

Do you have a friend who just started a new job? A new job often brings
changes in commuting distance, finances, or lifestyle. For example, your
friend may have taken a night shift, and their home is too noisy during
the day to get a good night’s sleep. One solution is to find a quiet
neighborhood with lower daytime noise so your friend can rest properly.
A new job could also mean new friends and shifts in social life. Perhaps
their current living situation is no longer ideal. For example, someone
who recently graduated and lives with their parents might find that
their new job provides the financial means to live on their own. That
new job creates an opportunity for you to help them find a new home to
purchase.

One reason someone might consider buying or selling real estate is a
major promotion at work that makes a larger, better home more affordable
now. Therefore, it is helpful to understand the business situations of
people in your circle of friends. Are their careers progressing? Did
they get a promotion? If so, are they thinking about upgrading their
home? Or might they be considering buying a vacation home? You will
likely meet people socially, especially within your sphere of influence,
who mention a promotion or a new job. If that happens, consider how that
change could lead to new real estate needs.

Another reason someone might need to sell their home is that they have
lost their job or need to relocate for a new one. In either case, your
friend—the seller—is highly motivated, and the timeline is urgent. They
will also aim to maximize their sale price. So, your sales pitch should
focus on those three points. This would be a fantastic opportunity to
offer them a friends-and-family discount on your commission as a
goodwill gesture.

Some companies transfer employees between locations within the same
organization. These job transfers might include company assistance with
selling their current home and buying a new one. As a real estate
professional, you could help with either of these transactions. To
secure these opportunities, consider building relationships with local
companies that transfer people between job sites. Reach out to their
personnel departments, visit in person to meet the personnel director,
and send a mail-merged printed letter describing your services.

You could offer to pick up employees at the airport and escort them and
their families around their new city. You could show them suitable homes
that meet their criteria and take them around town. Use the showings
feature of your real estate CRM to preview the selected homes and plan a
curated route so that you make the most of their time. With careful
planning and use of the **route planning** feature in your CRM, you
could pick them up from the airport, show them a few homes, take them
out to dinner, and drop them back off at the airport—all in a single
long day.


> **The Showing Scorecard Secret:** After enough showings, your buyer will start to blur the houses they see together. Use your CRM’s showings feature to log their thoughts on each property they tour. If they forget which house had the nice fence or stonework, you can remind them, even if weeks have gone by.


For sellers, you can add value by offering to list their old house. You
could also offer to monitor their vacant home and arrange services that
a recently transferred employee might not be able to handle after moving
out of town. For example, you can use the vendors’ list in your CRM’s
contacts database to arrange lawn care and any necessary repairs.

For a longer-term situation, you can use the rental management features
in your CRM to provide rental management if your client decides to rent
their property instead of selling it.

About 64% of job transfers include some form of relocation assistance.
These benefits typically cover living expenses, home-finding trips,
moving costs, and assistance selling the current home. The most common
approaches to selling the home are a Guaranteed Buyout (GBO) or an
Amended Value (BVO), both managed by a Relocation Management Company
(RMC). A GBO provides the employee with an immediate offer based on
independent appraisals, enabling a quick sale and move. A BVO is similar
but allows the employee to find their own buyer; if that buyer backs
out, the RMC steps in to buy the home at an amended, guaranteed value.
These programs are highly desired because they guarantee a commission
and a smooth, timely closing.

When working with an RMC, your commission may be reduced because a
portion will be paid as a referral fee. Before engaging, be sure to
follow their strict protocols; failure to do so can jeopardize your
commission. You can use your CRM to document the final commission after
the referral fee. You should also follow the RMC’s specific
documentation requirements to meet their deadlines and stay compliant.
Building relationships with these RMCs can lead to a steady source of
repeat, high-value business. Your ability to assist the employee during
the transfer process is valuable to both the employer and the employee.

While closing a single deal like this is beneficial, the true goal is to
become the preferred agent for multiple transactions with that employer.
Therefore, you might spend time building relationships with the HR
departments of local employers in the neighborhoods you serve. Identify
the largest employers in the area and add them to your CRM, including
the contact details for the person responsible for relocation
assistance. A mailed cover letter, along with a packet of information
about your services, would be exactly what is needed.

For executive relocation assistance, a higher level of service is
expected. If that is your target, you should list the additional
services you optionally provide, such as nanny services, driver
services, and airport pickup and drop-off.


> **Firm Friend Secret:** By building relationships with large local companies that have employee relocation programs, you can offer specialized services to help transferring employees buy or sell homes with a minimum of disruption. This is an excellent source of repeat business.


An employee taking part in a job transfer is a valued team member. The
employer will appreciate how you can minimize disruption to their
employee’s life. Your ability to add value sets you apart from other
agents. You should consider the large employers within commuting
distance of your area. These high-touch services offer an extra level of
service that justifies a full commission, which is always a positive.

## Divorce

Divorce can be a tough period for everyone involved, especially
children. An interesting statistic shows that 61% of divorces involve
the sale of the marital home. If someone you know is going through a
divorce, stay close to them because there is a better-than-even chance
they will need your services soon. A good way to stay in touch is to set
up a follow-up schedule in your real estate CRM. Your services may be
needed not only to sell the home but also to estimate its value during
asset division. So, it’s important to check in every few weeks
throughout the divorce process to offer emotional support and
trustworthy real estate advice.

If you want to expand beyond your current sphere of influence, consider
becoming a real estate agent who specializes in divorce cases. A great
way to generate divorce leads is to build relationships with family law
attorneys. Sending emails to divorce attorneys seeking their support is
typically ineffective. Instead, I recommend using your real estate CRM's
mail merge feature to send a printed letter. Identify attorneys who
specialize in divorce law in your area. Enter their information into
your real estate CRM, including their name, phone number, email address,
website, and other relevant details. Initially, establish relationships
with at least three attorneys who might consider recommending you.


In many cases, the divorcing couple will select their own real estate
agent. However, that may be impractical due to a lack of trust between
the parties; in such a case, the attorney could recommend a neutral
agent, such as you. As you build a reputation within the community of
lawyers, you will be able to draw upon recommendations that will
significantly improve your odds of being hired. Divorce attorneys often
have a heavy workload, so once you are considered a solid agent, you
should expect a steady amount of work.

To elevate your status beyond that of a listing agent, consider
specialized training. Certifications such as the Certified Divorce Real
Estate Expert (CDRE) or similar designations demonstrate your
understanding of the complex legal, financial, and emotional aspects of
these sales. This training focuses on the specific requirements for
valuation in court-ordered situations, preparing you to handle cases
where the home may be sold under direct court supervision. Attorneys are
highly motivated to use an agent with an official designation, as it
adds a layer of professional credibility to the valuation that can be
presented in settlement or in court.

You can use the education section of your real estate CRM to track your
progress toward CDRE certification. In many states, this certification
counts toward the continuing education requirements for license renewal.

Your first step is to prospect the attorneys you have selected. Create a
complete packet of information, including details about the services you
provide and the areas you serve, along with a mail-merged cover letter
generated in your real estate CRM. Send the packet via postal mail.

You should call after a week to check whether the attorney has received
your packet and whether they have any questions. You might also offer to
drop by, as you will be in the area later in the day, and would love to
discuss how you might assist with an analysis of the value of marital
property and with its sale.

As with buyers and sellers, follow up with each attorney more than once,
using multiple communication channels. Use the touch cycle features in
your CRM to ensure it is completed.

The legal process of a divorce can often be lengthy, with your role as a
real estate expert potentially lasting a year or more. During this time,
attorneys will rely on your expert opinion to determine a fair, neutral
valuation of the marital home for asset division.

You will be asked to provide a **Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)**
that evaluates recently sold, currently listed, and expired properties
in a specific area to estimate a home’s likely sale price. This value
will be used to determine the division of marital assets. Your ability
to accurately assess a value that is reasonably close to the final sale
price will be an essential factor in gaining additional business, so
take the time to do your due diligence.

One particularly compelling prospecting approach is to offer a CMA for
three properties the divorce attorney is currently handling. The
understanding would be that these CMAs could serve as a second opinion
and be used alongside the current real estate professional already
engaged for the CMA and sale. The advantage of this approach is that the
attorney really has no reason to turn down your offer.

If the couple decides to sell the house as part of the settlement, your
established relationship positions you to assist with the transaction,
but that is not guaranteed. Just because you’ve provided the CMA does
not mean you will be asked to list the property. Therefore, you should
maintain regular contact with the attorney and the seller using the
touch cycle features in your CRM.

The property being sold may be in poor condition due to the marital
situation. There might be items in need of repair, holes in the walls,
and damaged doors. Due to animosity, one of the sellers may be less
inclined to make the house look its best for showings. For this reason,
you might need to use your skills to bring a different kind of buyer to
the table, such as an investor willing to overlook cosmetic blemishes
and able to close quickly. If you keep a list of special-situation
investors in your CRM contacts database, now would be the time to pull
them out and let them know about a special situation coming to market.


> **Attorney’s Ally Secret:** Befriend divorce attorneys and offer neutral property valuations for their cases. By offering these services, you increase the odds of gaining an eventual listing. Divorce attorneys are an excellent source of repeat business.


Divorce sales can be emotionally charged, and your primary role is to
serve as a neutral, stabilizing force. To do so, use your real estate
CRM to maintain completely separate communication channels and records
for each party. Ensure you keep separate contact records for the husband
and wife, each with their own email address, phone number, and mailing
address. It is crucial that you stay in regular contact with the
attorney and both of your clients. Divorce deals like these mean you
have three people to keep informed, so it is extra work, but the last
thing you want is for anyone to feel you were not keeping them “in the
loop”.

Log every phone call, email, and text message for each individual in
their own contact record within your CRM. This careful record-keeping
helps you deliver fair service and creates a communication log that can
protect you if disputes occur between the divorcing couple. In divorce
situations, avoid including both the husband and wife in the same email
chain; instead, send separate emails to each party. This straightforward
practice prevents accidental ‘reply-all’ incidents and protects each
party’s confidential feedback.

You can use the parties section of your transaction manager to track
both sellers. That way, both sellers receive your weekly status and
service reports, allowing them to see progress. Be careful with any
notes you add to your CRM, as they might offend one party. There may be
animosity between the parties, and the last thing you want to do is make
that worse.

## Probate Real Estate

When a property owner passes away, the estate executor faces the
challenging task of managing assets during a time of grief. As a real
estate professional, your role isn’t that of a typical salesperson but
that of a trusted and compassionate advisor. This calls for a patient,
methodical approach that emphasizes providing value and expertise well
before a listing agreement is signed.

In 1989, AARP reported that 90% of probate cases involving people age 60
and older included the disposition of real estate. This means that if
you know someone whose older family member just died, there is a good
chance a real estate agent will need to be involved in handling some
portion of the estate. That could involve selling the home or conducting
a CMA to estimate the property’s value. If someone in your circle of
influence passes away, it is a time of mourning for you and others who
knew your friend. It is also understandable that, in addition to
offering comfort, your services as a real estate agent might be
necessary for your friend in need.

There are also methods for you to find probate listings through
prospecting. One option is to subscribe to a lead-aggregation service
that provides probate leads. One such service is ForeclosuresDaily, but
others are available online. You would download a weekly CSV file from
your probate service and import it into your real estate CRM using your
CRM’s valet import feature. The advantage of this method is that all the
preliminary work, including gathering information about the deceased,
the property, and contact details for attorneys and executors, has
already been completed.

Another method is to collect this information yourself by reviewing
public death notices and researching property tax records. Although it
can be tedious, once you’ve done this a few times, you can repeat it
weekly and get fairly reliable results. This approach can save you money
and might even provide more accurate information than subscribing to a
lead service.

There is also a third approach: building a referral network by
connecting with local professionals who handle wills and estates, such
as lawyers, financial advisors, and accountants. These professionals
often need a trusted agent who can provide impartial property valuations
during estate planning and after a death. You can also contact them
directly with a series of professionally formatted mail-merged letters.
If you opt for this approach, it can drastically reduce the time you
spend prospecting, as the attorney would provide a letter of
introduction to the executor.

Regardless of how you gather the information, the main advantage of
working with probate leads is the reliability of the results. Once you
establish a system and see results with a few leads, you can expand your
prospecting with little extra effort. The ability to grow, along with
consistent results, makes this a uniquely predictable prospecting
pipeline for agents willing to operate in what some might consider an
emotionally charged field.

Once you have compiled your list, the next step is initial outreach,
which is the most delicate stage. Aggressive cold calling is
inappropriate and likely to backfire, making you seem like a “hearse
chaser.” The best approach is a drip campaign of printed letters. Given
the sensitive nature of the topic, you should avoid email for your
initial contact. An unsolicited email about a probate can be easily
misunderstood and may provoke a negative reaction. A series of four
printed letters, spaced over five weeks, is a good starting point. These
letters should focus on showing empathy and offering help before
requesting their business.


> **Probate Patience Secret:** Prospect probate leads with patience and sensitivity. The agent who acts as a trusted advisor, not a pushy salesperson, ultimately wins the listing.


The legal probate process often takes 6 to 9 months, and sometimes
longer, to settle a property[21]. Your CRM is essential for managing
this lengthy timeline. Use it to plan your letter sequence and follow-up
calls, and to carefully record every interaction. The competition for
probate leads is low, and the success rate is high. This increased
likelihood of success justifies spending more time on each lead.

By using your CRM’s prospects database, you can track the property
address as well as the executor’s address. You do not want to send
correspondence to the property; instead, send it to the executor’s
mailing address. You should also take advantage of the parties’ section
of your prospects database to record the full contact details for the
deceased, the executor, and the attorney. This information is separate,
so you’ll need full contact details for all three individuals associated
with that prospect record. Under some circumstances, there may not be an
attorney.

Sending a series of mail-merged letters that reference the property’s
address but are addressed to the executor, include the deceased’s name,
and mention the attorney, is a complex process. You can automate some of
these tasks using the **mail merge variables** in your CRM. However,
given the sensitivity of the matter, I recommend that you review and
personally edit the final draft of each letter. It is unlikely you can
fully automate the process, and some manual entry into the mail-merged
letters will always be required before printing. Just as we live our
lives as individuals, death is also unique to each person.

Once you have established contact, focus on providing value. Executors
and beneficiaries sometimes live in different cities or states, making
it impossible for them to manage the property directly. They will
appreciate your expertise in navigating the complexities of the sale
from afar. Offer to prepare a formal CMA for the estate and a seller net
sheet to clarify the financials.

Since many probate properties are vacant, you can add extra value by
monitoring the home. This includes coordinating lawn care, suggesting
repairs, and conducting security checks to prevent vandalism. You can
also assist in coordinating the disposal of personal property, such as
recommending a reputable estate sale company to handle the home’s
contents. This service is invaluable to an overwhelmed executor.


> **Pen Pal Probate Secret:** Prioritize probate leads where the executor lives out of town. Sellers are more likely to be motivated to move the property quickly, and less likely to pit your services against those of other listing agents.


Finally, you will handle the probate sale. These properties may have
been neglected if the previous owner was elderly or ill, often requiring
major maintenance or renovation. This condition makes them less
attractive to traditional buyers but ideal for your investor clients,
who can make quick, all-cash offers. Beneficiaries are usually eager to
receive their inheritance, so a fast, reliable closing often matters
more than the highest price.

Ensure the person signing the listing agreement has the legal authority
to represent the estate. Usually, the seller should be the named
Executor or Personal Representative and hold the Letters Testamentary or
Letters of Administration issued by the probate court. Without this
court document, the agreement is invalid, and the sale cannot proceed.
When working with an executor, request a copy of this official document
and store it in your CRM’s **document management system** to confirm you
have the proper legal authority from the start.

State-specific laws add complexity to the sale process. For example,
California includes an auction step in which the accepted offer can be
outbid in court.

To stand out as a probate specialist, consider pursuing specialized
training. Certifications such as the Certified Probate Real Estate
Specialist (CPRES) or similar designations demonstrate your
understanding of the complex legal, financial, and emotional factors
involved in these transactions. This training highlights the specific
valuation requirements for court-ordered cases, preparing you to handle
situations where the home may be sold under court supervision. Attorneys
prefer working with an agent who holds an official designation, as it
adds credibility to the valuation used in settlements or court. Use the
education section of your real estate CRM to track your progress toward
this certification, as it may also count toward the continuing education
credits needed for your license renewal.

The legal complexities and long timelines of probate sales can seem
intimidating at first. However, these challenges are exactly what create
a strong competitive advantage for you. While most agents compete
fiercely for the same traditional listings, a probate specialist is
valued for their ability to guide clients through the legal red tape and
ensure their loved one’s financial affairs are settled. This focus
results in a less crowded niche and often greater profitability. A
careful, long-term strategy required for these deals is ideal for a
detail-oriented agent who uses their CRM to nurture multiple leads
simultaneously. This approach transforms a complex process into a
steady, profitable workflow.

One way to break into probate real estate sales is to hire a real estate
agent mentor in another city who already works with probate leads.
Because you won’t be competing with them, they will be willing to share
the best approaches to probate leads, sample letters, and recommended
strategies. There is also an online community of other real estate
professionals who share information about working with probate leads.
One such community is US Probate Leads.

Maintain regular contact with each attorney who provides referrals. Add
each referring attorney to your “Top100” category. Also, establish a
90-day touch cycle and include them in your “Christmas” category so they
receive a holiday card. After each closing, personally thank the
referring attorney and give a small token of appreciation. Use your real
estate CRM to track these referrals by entering the attorney’s name in
the **“referred by” field**. At year’s end, review all referrals from
each attorney. For key referral sources, show extra appreciation—perhaps
with complimentary theater tickets or another gesture of gratitude.

## Upsizing and Downsizing

The primary reason for upsizing is that the family has grown larger,
possibly due to the birth of a new baby or an extended family member
moving in. Your friend might be selling an existing home and buying
another one, perhaps nearby. As an agent specializing in these moves,
you can help the homeowner with many details, such as how they will
transition between homes.

Wealthy clients may choose to buy the new home first, move in, and then
sell the older home once it becomes vacant. Although this method is
convenient for the family, it carries risks and costs: if the old home
doesn’t sell quickly, the homeowner could end up paying for two
mortgages simultaneously.

A second approach would be to list the first home for sale, then
scramble to find a new home in the short window between contract and
closing on the existing home. This option is the most common and also
the most complex to arrange. Timing must be impeccable. An agent
experienced in these kinds of situations has a competitive advantage
when speaking with clients. They can explain strategies to maximize the
odds of success.

Of course, in the worst case, the homeowner can move into temporary
housing while they find a new home, but that means packing their
belongings into storage and doing a double move. No fun, especially if
school-age children are involved.


> **The Stepping Stone Directive:** Helping someone upsize or downsize can be tricky because it involves selling one home and buying another at the same time. If you manage both transactions, that’s double the commission and double the risk of something going wrong. Use your CRM to coordinate contingencies, timing, and complexity.


This type of transaction is called a concurrent closing and typically
involves a contingent offer on the new home. In this case, the
contingency would be the sale of the old home, which must occur before
closing on the new one. A contingency is a clause in a purchase
agreement that must be satisfied for the contract to become legally
binding. This means the purchase of the new home depends on the sale of
the old home. A concurrent closing with a contingency sale is less
attractive to sellers than one without such a contingency. Your ability
to clearly explain the benefits and feasibility of this offer will be
key to closing the deal. You might also negotiate a rent-back agreement,
allowing your client to remain in their current home for a few weeks
after closing until they move into their new home. Again, your
experience and persuasion skills will be crucial, as most buyers prefer
to take possession immediately after closing.

Use your real estate **CRM's contingency-tracking** features to monitor
these contingencies. In this case, the seller must schedule the closing
date for the new home immediately after the closing of their existing
home, possibly even minutes later.

If you’re fortunate enough to handle both transactions for your client,
you’ll have a slight advantage in coordinating the process and
increasing your chances of success. This gives your client a strong
incentive to select you for both deals.

The available down payment will likely depend on the sale price.
Therefore, accurate net calculations for both buyer and seller are
crucial to helping your client find a new home within their budget,
based on the net proceeds from selling their current house. Your real
estate CRM can support these calculations and track the timing of both
transactions. In this case, you’ll have two linked transactions in your
CRM, with the second contingent on the sale of the first.

To reduce your client’s risk, you should arrange a consultation between
your client and a trusted mortgage professional experienced in this type
of transaction. Your client’s down payment is likely tied up in their
current home. Additionally, the loan for the new home should be applied
for with the assumption that the current home will be sold. Otherwise,
the loan could be denied because it assumes the homeowner would be
paying two mortgages at once. This process is more complex than a
standard loan application and may require applying for a different type
of loan. Since these deals are more complex, approvals will take longer,
and the pre-approval might be more detailed than usual.

The stress of a concurrent closing often peaks during the move. To
provide exceptional service, you can offer your client a curated list of
moving companies and professional packing and unpacking services. If
your client plans to sell their first home in the morning and buy the
new one in the afternoon, what happens to all their belongings? You
can’t instantly transfer everything from one home to the next.

One way to handle this is to use temporary storage units, often called
PODS. These storage containers are delivered to your client’s current
home a few weeks before the move. Your clients can then take their time
packing and storing their belongings in the PODS. At closing, the buyer
will inspect an empty house with the PODS sitting on the curb. After
closing, the PODS are moved to your client’s new home and unpacked.

By using these temporary storage units, your client also has some
breathing room between moves. They could stay in a hotel for a few days,
for example, if the second closing is delayed.

One type of home seller who might be sympathetic to a concurrent closing
is a new home builder. They have flexibility on the move-in date because
the home is unoccupied, and they might be able to adjust the completion
date to align with the closing of the other house. By building
relationships with new home builders, you could gain an advantage when
working with them.

You might also target vacant homes for the step-up home, since those
properties would be available for immediate occupancy and could
accommodate the buyer’s short timeframe.

Another reason for selling is the need to downsize. This is another
situation where you might need to manage two transactions. Retirement
often involves downsizing, which may include buying a new home in a
different city, such as Florida or Arizona. If you are unable to handle
the transaction yourself because you don’t serve the area they are
moving to, you should offer to connect your seller with a real estate
agent you know in the destination city. This allows you to earn referral
income by finding an agent willing to accept your referral in exchange
for a portion of the commission on the new home purchase. You can use
your real estate CRM to stay in regular contact with the agent in the
other city and track the referral income you earn when that sale is
completed.

Knowing when someone has outgrown their current home and is considering
moving up or down can be straightforward if you recognize the signs. You
might hear a friend say they are “busting at the seams” now that little
Johnny is getting older. Or they might mention that, with the kids out
of the house, the place feels empty, and they are considering relocating
to a place with a smaller yard or a better climate. Pay close attention
to these signs. As their friend and trusted advisor, you are
well-positioned to offer helpful advice.

For some prospects, upsizing or downsizing is optional, driven by desire
rather than necessity. Your role is to sell the dream of the next phase
of life by highlighting the emotional and lifestyle gains their current
home cannot provide. For upsizing, focus the conversation on future
memories and family growth. You are selling a higher quality of life and
the physical space to achieve their family goals.

For downsizers, the focus should be on freedom and a simpler way of
living. Highlight the low-maintenance lifestyle—no more large yard work,
lower utility bills, or a single-story layout for easier aging.
Emphasize the new home’s proximity to amenities like restaurants,
cultural centers, and healthcare, presenting the move as a way to save
time and money for travel and hobbies.

By consistently reinforcing these specific emotional benefits, you
position the move as a necessary step toward their ideal future
lifestyle. By offering a clear plan and sharing your experiences with
similar projects for other clients, you reassure them that risks can be
managed and that they can succeed. You can also emphasize why you are
the best and only agent to assist them with this move.

## Our Furry Friends

Our pets play a vital role in our daily lives. Would it surprise you to
learn that about half of pet owners consider their pets as much family
as any human member? In the US alone, there are 90 million households
with pets. That’s more than the 30 million households with children
under 18. There is roughly one pet for every two people in the USA.

A SunTrust Mortgage survey found that 33% of millennial homebuyers said
their decision to buy a home was driven primarily by their dog,
surpassing marriage and children. When helping a buyer find their
forever home, consider their pet’s needs as well. For some, it is the
main factor in their decision-making! When comparing two homes—one with
a fenced yard and one without—one with a fenced yard is preferred by 49%
of pet-owning buyers. You can track the home features a buyer is looking
for in your real estate CRM to see which are most important to them.


Your ability to understand the needs of the entire family will help
identify which home looks perfect from the buyer’s perspective. They
might prefer a house with a yard or a nearby park for playing frisbee.
These preferences can also shape which neighborhoods or home types they
consider. For example, a condominium might not be suitable for Fido, or
an urban setting might be ruled out. If your client has a pet that tends
to howl, whine, or bark frequently, they might prefer a large yard with
plenty of space between their home and the neighbors[22]. People with
small dogs might even prefer ranch-style living to better accommodate
their tiny feet.

In any case, it helps to keep track of which pets your clients and
friends have[23]. Your **CRM should include a field for tracking pets**;
if it doesn’t, add this information to your notes. You should also find
out whether your client celebrates their pet’s birthday, and if so,
record that date in the annual dates field of your CRM. Most real
estate-specific CRMs can store multiple annual dates, such as birthdays
for the client, spouse, children, and pets, as well as the closing date
of the home you sold them. Each of these dates is significant and offers
an excellent opportunity to make a quick call when it arrives. “Just
wanted to wish Fido a happy birthday! How’s it going?” Your CRM enables
you to view all these birthdays and anniversaries in a single,
date-sorted list. You can mark the task complete once you have sent your
well wishes, and it will reappear next year on the same date.


> **The Fencing Friend Secret:** Maintain a relationship with a reliable fencing contractor. Dog owners are likely to prefer a fenced yard, and might not realize how easily a house without a fence can be made perfect with the addition of a fence.


Tracking whether a loved one, even a pet, has passed away is something
friends do. If you learn that a family pet has died, you might send a
**pet condolence eCard** or a traditional physical card by mail. Your
real estate CRM can help you print a mailing label for a card sent by
postal mail. If you’d like, you can even use the pet condolence eCards
to send your thoughts via text message.

As a real estate agent, you’ve seen many homes with pets. Have you ever
wondered whether you can learn something about the homeowner from their
pets? You can. Americans in rural areas are more likely to own pets than
those in suburban and urban areas. 71% of adults in rural areas have a
pet. Strangers shown only photographs can match purebred dogs to their
owners 64% of the time—six times better than random guessing—because the
pairs genuinely resemble each other. This research goes beyond skin
deep. Studies have shown that a dog’s personality often predicts its
owner’s personality. While you may not be able to judge a book by its
cover, you might be able to judge the owner by spending a few minutes
with their pet!

If you have a listing with pets, there are a few things to keep in mind.
You should talk with the owner about having a professional
carpet-cleaning company deodorize the house. They will deep-clean the
carpets, then apply enzyme-based cleaning solutions that break down
urine. Consider adding room fresheners to mask any remaining pet scents.

While many people love pets, others do not. You should also consider
that approximately 10% of the population is allergic to pet dander,
which is the shed skin cells and hair from dogs and cats. Nearly 30% of
people are sensitive to pet dander. So, a clean, odor-free space is your
best approach to selling a home. You never know what the new owner will
prefer, and if they are allergic to pet dander, you want to allow them
to consider your listing without eliminating it.

You should also include pet details in your CRM and MLS notes, along
with your lockbox instructions. While many pets are friendly and
showings usually go smoothly, it’s important to prevent potential buyers
from being surprised by a vicious Rottweiler or pit bull. Your buyer can
also use baby gates to restrict pets’ access to certain parts of the
house during showings. Signs posted in areas where pets are kept, such
as the garage and back yard, can serve as helpful reminders for the
showing agent. Lastly, it’s a good idea to ask the showing agent to
ensure that fence gates are always closed after a showing to prevent
pets from escaping.

Some agents may refuse to show a home if an aggressive dog is present.
In such cases, you should arrange to have the aggressive pet removed for
a few hours so the house can be shown at its best. You should discuss
this with your homeowner if they have an aggressive pet. Sometimes the
easiest solution is to place the aggressive dog next door in the
neighbor’s yard for a few hours. A frightened showing agent cannot do
their best, and it’s in your best interest to be considerate of their
needs. Each year, documented cases show that real estate agents have
been attacked, and some have been hospitalized, due to out-of-control
pets in the house during showings.

If, while showing a home, you see a pet in danger or being abused,
contact the listing agent so they can handle the issue directly with the
seller. As a real estate agent, you are not a mandatory reporter, so you
are not required to alert the authorities. However, this situation must
be addressed immediately for the pet’s health and the safety of anyone
showing the home. In some cases, feces and excessive filth can be
dangerous when inhaled or touched. These issues will affect the home’s
price, and the homeowner should be made aware so they can address the
issue directly, rather than at closing with a lower sales price.

Some homes may be unshowable due to pet issues. These issues may include
a large number of animals, aggressive behavior, or odors and feces
beyond reasonable control. In these situations, as the listing agent,
you may need to market the property in a special way. For example, an
investor might be interested in buying such a home at a lower price.
This is where a good agent can demonstrate their value, as unique
situations require unique marketing strategies.

When you first meet with a client, take time to get to know the entire
family, including the pets. Ask about their needs. If the pets like you,
you’ve passed a key test. If they don’t, you probably won’t get hired by
the owners. Pets are a pretty good judge of character, after all!
