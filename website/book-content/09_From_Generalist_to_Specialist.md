# From Generalist to Specialist

> “So why is it that Specialists work far less and earn far more?
> Because they are sought out, in demand, and relevant.”

—Knolly Williams, *Success With Listings*

Every real estate agent who is a member of the MLS can sell any house
listed on the MLS. This is a powerful advantage for new agents because
it creates a level playing field for all agents. However, it also poses
a challenge. How do you stand out from all of the other agents?

One way is to focus on a specific niche within the real estate market.
For example, you could specialize in working with investors seeking
rental properties or assisting military veterans.

You can then use targeted marketing to identify both buyers and sellers
in that specific market segment. Over time, you also gain a better
understanding of that segment’s unique needs and could even develop a
reputation as an expert in that field. The advantage of focusing on a
real estate niche is that it helps you gain a competitive edge and
deepen your understanding of that segment’s unique needs, enabling you
to be more effective in your job.

## Real Estate Investors

Working with an investor can be advantageous because investors are more
likely to understand real estate transactions, have financing in place,
and close deals quickly. However, they may prefer lowball offers and are
primarily motivated by profit, making strong negotiation skills
essential on your part.

What truly distinguishes an investor from a typical homebuyer is their
willingness to explore opportunities that other buyers might avoid. A
traditional buyer usually prefers a move-in-ready home that will pass a
lender’s appraisal. An investor seeks undervalued opportunities, such as
distressed properties or properties that can be remodeled for profit.
They also look for properties that can be rented to generate positive
cash flow or flipped for quick profit.

An investor’s unique interests make them a valuable strategic asset.
Sellers in distressed situations, such as divorce or probate, may prefer
a quick sale with few or no contingencies rather than maximizing the
price. This is where your investor client provides the perfect solution.
Your ability to connect an investor with the seller of a
difficult-to-sell property positions you as a problem-solver. You can
also proactively identify these opportunities for your investor clients,
benefiting both parties.


> **The Interested Investor Secret:** When pitching a seller who needs a quick sale, mention that you sometimes work with cash buyers who are ready to close fast. Use your contacts database to stay in touch with deep-pocketed investors who are interested in special situations.


Your CRM is the ideal tool for managing this valuable niche. By keeping
a list of investors in your contacts database, you can notify them of
opportunities that meet their criteria. If you come across a distressed
property, one with unique challenges, or one that requires a quick sale,
you will have a ready-made list of buyers you can contact.

A robust CRM offers specialized features crucial to this work. You will
need to generate a **Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)**, a report that
estimates a home’s value based on recently sold comparable
properties. For each potential property, you can help your investor
determine whether it represents a good value. Your CRM should also
include offer tracking to manage multiple offers and counteroffers for
the same buyer. Since many investors are cash buyers, your CRM’s task
plans should be flexible enough to accommodate deals without lending
contingencies.

By specializing in investor buyers, you can also focus on listing the
types of properties that interest investors. These include distressed
properties, undervalued properties, properties that generate positive
cash flow through rental, and multi-family real estate that can be
purchased and rented for profit.


You can hire trusted locals to act as bird dogs, spotting vacant houses,
neglected properties, or new FSBO signs in their neighborhoods. In real
estate investing, a “bird dog” is someone who scouts potential deals
(often distressed or off-market properties) for investors in exchange
for a fee or “bounty.” When they find something promising, they send you
a quick photo, address, and details in exchange for a set bounty. This
way, you become aware of these opportunities early and can prospect them
before other agents. In a hot market, using human intelligence gathering
can give you an edge over others who rely on subscription services,
which tend to lag by several weeks.

There are lead services you can use to identify FSBOs, probates, and
pre-foreclosure leads. You’re seeking a homeowner eager to get rid of
their mortgage quickly. In such cases, the seller is willing to accept a
lower price for a faster closing date. An investor will do that kind of
deal all day long.

Using the **rent vs. own calculator** in your CRM can help identify
opportunities where rental income easily covers the property’s mortgage.
Rental rates vary across a city, with some areas commanding higher
average rents than others. These higher-rent neighborhoods are preferred
by investors and should be the focus of your marketing. For example, in
a college town, housing near campus usually rents for more than similar
properties just a mile away. Many students don’t have cars, so walking
distance or proximity to a bus line is crucial, and they are willing to
pay extra for that convenience.

Investors are sensitive to shifts in economic conditions, including
interest and rental rates. As their trusted real estate advisor, you can
alert them when it’s a good time to adjust their portfolios based on
these factors. Use your real estate CRM’s rent-vs-own calculator to help
determine whether it makes sense for your investors to sell or buy a
property given these economic changes.

Private investors hold real estate investments for an average of 4.6
years, significantly shorter than the 11-year average for residential
homeowners. This makes an investor client particularly valuable, as
investors typically do more than one deal, and there’s a good chance
that every property you help them buy, you can help them sell
eventually.

Beyond the initial purchase, an investor’s focus shifts to generating
returns, typically by flipping the property or holding it as a rental.
Your CRM is crucial for supporting both approaches. For clients who
choose to become landlords, a


CRM with **property management** features helps you offer property
management services—this is particularly valuable for an inexperienced
investor. These features let you track tenant details, rent payments,
and maintenance requests, creating an additional revenue stream for your
business. If the investor prefers to handle rental management
themselves, you can also provide services to find a renter by listing
the property on the MLS.

While each investor aims for maximum return, the flip strategy carries
risks you are uniquely qualified to help mitigate. The investor needs to
estimate a fair asking price after remodeling is complete. They are
likely to ask for your help preparing a hypothetical Comparative Market
Analysis (CMA) to determine that figure. You might also suggest running
a seller net calculation that includes commissions and closing costs.
With this information, your investor can account for remodeling and
holding costs to assess profit potential.

The main risk in a flip is cost overruns or delays, which can quickly
erode profit margins. Therefore, when advising a client on a flip,
emphasize the importance of a contingency budget (usually 10-15% of the
renovation cost) to cover unexpected expenses, such as structural or
system issues, helping the investor—and your reputation—avoid financial
disaster.

You might also consider analyzing current rental market conditions and
estimating the property’s pre- and post-remodeling rental rates. You
could then use that information along with the rent-to-own calculator in
your CRM to decide whether it’s more advantageous to rent the property
instead of flipping, and whether remodeling makes sense.

When it’s time for your investor to sell an asset, you can add value by
advising them on the tax benefits of a 1031 exchange, a strategy under
the U.S. tax code that allows an investor to avoid capital gains taxes
on the sale of an investment property by reinvesting the proceeds (via a
Qualified Intermediary) into a new, ‘like-kind’ property within a strict
timeframe[19]. If your client chooses this option, you will earn two
commissions: one for the sale of the original property and another for
the purchase of a replacement property of equal or greater value. Beyond
doubling the commission opportunity, a 1031 exchange also creates time
pressure because the offer must be made and accepted within a short
timeframe, and the exchange must be closed quickly afterward. This means
your investor is more concerned with timing than price. That second deal
must be completed to avoid taxes, making it far more likely to close
than it might otherwise be.

The timing of these deals has to be exact. You can use your CRM’s
transaction management tools to monitor contingencies, deadlines,
inspections, involved parties, and other details, making sure nothing
delays either deal’s closing. Once the first transaction is complete,
there’s a limited window to secure an accepted offer for the second,
which must also be completed within a designated period.

Maintaining a vendor list of tradespeople in your CRM can be valuable
for time-sensitive investors. When your client needs a trusted
inspector, contractor, plumber, or electrician for a renovation or
rental repair, you can quickly provide a reliable referral. By serving
as a long-term, well-connected expert, you become a crucial part of your
investor’s team, ensuring a steady flow of repeat business.


> **The Outstanding Offer Secret:** Investors are looking strictly at the numbers, and do not fall in love with a property. A savvy investor might use multiple consecutive lowball offers with tight deadlines as a negotiating tactic. They might keep one offer active at a time, then once it’s rejected, quickly make an offer on a different property. The first seller to accept is the winner. Use your CRM to track each offer and its deadline, ensuring you do not have more than one offer active at a time.


If you’re selling in a market area with a college, you can target
parents looking to buy a rental property where their child can live
during college. This creates a unique investment opportunity that allows
parents to offer their child free lodging and even pay them to manage
and maintain the property. If the child brings on roommates, it can even
become profitable!

You should also consider that some people in your circle may be
interested in owning an investment property for rental. You could host a
real estate seminar on the benefits of rental properties. By providing a
full range of services, you can make it easier for first-time investors
to get started. You can help them find the right rental property and
secure tenants. You might even offer to manage the rental process for
them, and when it’s time to sell, you will be there to support them.

You might even offer seminars that highlight the benefits of being a
landlord. This can be particularly compelling when the stock market is
underperforming. You give people the opportunity to access an
alternative investment vehicle that is more stable and reliable than the
stock market. When someone owns a rental property, they can see their
investment firsthand.

## Rentals

As a real estate professional, you will encounter clients who either
cannot qualify to buy a home or do not want the responsibility. Or,
perhaps you have a listing that isn’t selling, but you’re confident you
can rent it. In either case, it makes sense to offer your services to
match a rental property with a renter. The typical fee for such services
is one month’s rent as a finder’s fee.

You might also offer rental management services, where you charge a
percentage of the monthly rent to ensure payments are made and cover any
necessary property upkeep. Keep in mind that if you offer to manage a
client’s property for a fee, you are acting as an agent or fiduciary.
This service requires a real estate license and, in some states, a
separate Property Management License to oversee client funds.


> **The Rental Reconnaissance Secret:** Managing rentals for someone else helps you learn how to handle rental management for when you eventually become a landlord yourself. Many real estate agents own rental properties and consider them an excellent investment for retirement1.

investment properties↩︎


Your real estate CRM can help you manage both finding a renter and
rental management. While you might prefer the higher reward and lower
hassle of a traditional closing, where you earn a commission and
complete the deal, rentals offer a diversified income stream that can be
beneficial when the economy slows. You may also eventually convert a
renter into a buyer or turn a rental into a future sale. You should use
your real estate CRM to track lease expirations and reach out to both
the buyer and the seller to determine whether your services are needed.

You can also rent out a property for short-term stays—such as a summer
cottage rented for the season or for a few weeks at a time. You would
handle tenant screening, collect rent, ensure cleaning services are
completed, and ensure the property is in excellent condition for rent.

Managing short-term vacation rentals (such as those listed on VRBO or
Airbnb) is often treated as hospitality or temporary lodging, similar to
operating a hotel. Consequently, these services usually do not require a
Property Management License unless the agent’s responsibilities include
general maintenance or financial activities that qualify as property
management under local laws. Always consult your state’s Real Estate
Commission and local ordinances on transient occupancy taxes before
engaging in any management activities.

The success of rental management hinges on meticulous tenant screening.
Your agency relationship requires you to protect the landlord’s assets
from damage, loss of rent, and liability. The CRM’s transaction
management features can support this required due diligence by tracking
tenant employment, obtaining credit reports, noting any prior eviction
history, and contacting prior landlords.

Finding qualified renters may require a different lead-generation
strategy than finding homebuyers. While the MLS handles some rental
listings, the most effective platforms are Craigslist, Facebook
Marketplace, Zillow Rentals, Apartments.com, and local university
housing portals (especially in college towns). Your marketing should
also be highly localized.

Eventually, you will likely discover an investment opportunity you want
to pursue personally. That makes you, the real estate professional, the
owner, landlord, and property manager. Your real estate CRM can help you
track this side of your business. Nearly all successful real estate
agents end up buying properties as personal investments, so it’s just
part of the business. When the time comes to sell that property, you, as
an agent, can manage that part as well!

## Vacation Homes

Selling vacation homes or a second home requires a unique marketing
approach. For a primary home, buyers prioritize the school system,
proximity to work, and amenities such as shopping. A vacation home is a
luxury purchase primarily for leisure. Therefore, emphasize the
amenities. A vacation home can often be shared with friends and family.
Take the time to discuss how owning a vacation home can bring families
together for gatherings and create memories. When you sell vacation
homes, you’re selling the dream, so concentrate on the intangible
benefits.


Many people rent out their second homes as short-term rentals when they
aren’t using them. This can help offset the costs of owning a second
property. There are tax implications to consider, and you should
understand these options to provide your clients with the most accurate
advice.

Second homes tend to turn over more quickly than traditional homes.
After a few years, many owners realize they are not using their second
home as much as they did when they first bought it. Staying in regular
contact with your buyer gives you a great chance to be the listing agent
for that sale. After all, who better to sell the property than the agent
who helped the buyer purchase it? The simplest way to do this is to use
your real estate CRM to track the closing anniversary. Call your buyer
each year to check in and see how things are going.


> **The Remote Reassurance Secret:** Owners of vacation homes may be unaware of the daily real estate activity near their homes, as they may visit only a few days each year. Periodic postcards, like “just listed / just sold,” and an annual summary of properties sold in the neighborhood are especially effective tools for fostering engagement among vacation homeowners. These postcards are valuable items that your prospects will likely keep. I recommend sending these cards to the owner’s home address rather than the vacation home’s address.


Maintaining phone contact with your past clients is important, but you
should also consider sending occasional postcards and other mailings to
the entire neighborhood. You can easily create a mailing list from local
property tax records, which include the owner’s name, property address,
and mailing address. Then import that data into your real estate CRM
using the valet import feature. Your CRM can store both a property
address and a mailing address in the prospects database. For vacation
homes, your mailing should not go to the vacation home address but
instead to the owner’s primary residence address. This mailing list is
ideal for postcards and periodic printed letters. You can use your CRM’s
mail merge feature to reference the vacation home’s address while
printing the label at the mailing address.

Your marketing budget is best spent on the warmest leads: individuals
already engaged with the vacation lifestyle. The most efficient lead
generation comes from intercepting potential buyers while they are
enjoying the area. One of the easiest ways to generate buyer leads is to
host multiple open houses, especially during periods when vacation homes
are actively rented. Someone renting a vacation home may dream of owning
one. Use the open house registry feature of your real estate CRM to
capture this information. In addition to follow-up calls, I recommend
creating a semiannual email newsletter that highlights activities in the
vacation community you serve. You’re selling the dream. When your
prospect reads about the clam bake by the beach this weekend, they are
one step closer to deciding that owning is far better than renting.

You can also expand your prospecting by partnering with local short-term
rental agencies and property owners in the area. You might be able to
obtain a mailing list of past clients. You could also include
information about your services in the welcome packet provided with the
short-term rental. Additionally, you can contact the local visitor’s
center to have a brochure and your business cards available there. You
might also be permitted to use the visitor registration log. Similarly,
reaching out to local hotels to arrange the same might also be
beneficial. 

Financing a second home differs from financing a primary residence.
Lenders view second homes as riskier, so buyers typically need larger
down payments and must meet stricter debt-to-income ratios. As an agent,
you should work with a lender experienced in second-home or investment
property loans. Additionally, vacation homes are sometimes purchased by
multiple parties, such as friends or extended family. You should be
familiar with common ownership structures, such as Tenancy in Common
(TIC) and Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), which help manage shared
expenses, liability, and usage schedules. Your ability to advise clients
on these financial and legal arrangements not only helps these deals go
more smoothly but also places you in the room when decisions are made.

Because this is an emotional, leisure-based purchase, the quality of
visual marketing is essential. Listings must go beyond standard photos
and use cinematic video tours and drone footage to showcase the full
experience—not just the house. The video should highlight the lifestyle:
a sunset view from the deck, a family gathered around the fire pit, or a
short walk to the lake. The focus should be on the community and the
experience, treating the property like a destination retreat. This
high-end, emotional presentation justifies the luxury purchase and helps
buyers envision the memories they will make.

## Veterans & Active Military

If you are a veteran or have a connection to one, this niche can be a
smart market to target. Veterans and active-duty military members are
spread across the United States, but some regions have higher
concentrations, making marketing to this group especially effective in
those areas. Although a veteran’s needs are similar to those of any
other homebuyer, they also have specific needs that are unique to their
experience. Your ability to empathize with and understand these needs
can be helpful when assisting military families with buying or selling a
home.

A VA loan is a powerful financial tool available exclusively to
active-duty service members and veterans, enabling home purchases with
little or no down payment. In a competitive market, offers financed with
a VA loan are sometimes viewed as less attractive because of stricter
appraisal and property-condition requirements. Your job is to
proactively address these misconceptions. When submitting a VA-financed
offer, you should immediately contact the listing agent, provide the
buyer’s strong pre-approval letter, and confidently explain that your
team—including the lender and inspector—is highly experienced with the
VA process and can ensure a smooth, timely closing. You can also appeal
to the agent’s sense of patriotism. This proactive communication is
essential to securing a contract for your veteran client.

While the zero-down-payment benefit of a VA loan is well known, another
advantage is that VA loans do not require Private Mortgage Insurance
(PMI), regardless of the down payment amount. For a borrower with a
conventional loan and a down payment of less than 20%, the monthly PMI
cost can be hundreds of dollars. Eliminating this fee provides
substantial monthly savings, significantly increasing your client’s
purchasing power and reducing their total housing cost.

Many veterans and service members mistakenly believe they can only use
their VA loan benefit once. The VA loan is a lifetime benefit, and the
entitlement is often fully restorable. Even if a veteran has already
used a VA loan and sold that home, they can apply to restore their full
entitlement and use the benefit again for their next purchase, often
with no restrictions on location or time. Additionally, if they still
own their first home, they may be able to use their remaining
“second-tier” entitlement to purchase a second home with a VA loan.


> **The Veteran’s Valet Secret:** Many listing agents dislike VA loans due to the strict appraisal requirements and associated delays. For this reason, VA loan offers are considered less competitive than other offers. You can deal with this concern by pre-inspecting the property against the VA Minimum Property Requirements before making an offer. After the property is inspected, you’ll need to show that your client’s financing won’t cause delays. Have your VA lender call the listing agent to confirm the buyer is fully underwritten and the loan is ready to close.


Active-duty military families are often required to relocate between
duty stations, sometimes across state lines or internationally.
Move-in-ready homes that are easy to sell are highly valued. Your client
will often face tight deadlines set by a Permanent Change of Station
(PCS) order. This often condenses house hunting into a short, intense
“House-Hunting Trip” (HHT) of about ten days. Increasingly, the entire
process must be managed remotely while the service member is deployed or
already at the new duty station.

Be prepared to conduct comprehensive virtual showings, including live
video tours and detailed neighborhood analysis. Because VA loans are
managed by a private entity but underwritten by the military, you should
build relationships with local mortgage professionals experienced in VA
loans. Additionally, it is important that you maintain a network of
local contractors and inspectors in your CRM contacts database who can
work on short notice. Your ability to provide dependable remote service
is a key differentiator in this niche.

Beyond the home itself, military families prioritize community and
support systems. As part of the services you offer your clients, include
resources for local school registration, connections to nearby military
family support groups, and identification of neighborhoods with high
concentrations of military residents. Your value is not just in selling
a house; it is in helping a family quickly and seamlessly integrate into
a new, unfamiliar community.

In many military moves, the spouse manages most of the logistics,
especially when the service member is deployed, in training, or has
already moved ahead to their new duty station. The military spouse is
often the primary decision-maker on the ground. When working with
military families, you must always treat the spouse as a critical
partner and the primary point of contact for day-to-day details.

You should maintain separate contact records for the husband and wife in
your database, each with complete contact information.

It is important to keep in touch with any active-duty family members you
have helped with a home purchase. They typically receive a Permanent
Change of Station (PCS) order on a 2-5-year cycle. This means it won’t
be long before your buyer becomes a seller.

Place the primary decision-maker (spouse) on a regular 90-day touch
cycle in your CRM. While the military can be predictable, orders can
arrive quickly, and military families need to be ready to move at a
moment’s notice.

Military families will be more aware than most others of how salable
their home is and what needs to be done to maintain its condition so it
is always ready to sell. If you send an annual CMA analysis of the
property’s value, it would be greatly appreciated and put you at the
front of the line when it comes time to select an agent to help sell the
property.

Many military families may move to another location for a few years but
expect to eventually return. In that case, instead of selling their
home, you might be asked to rent it for the duration of the military
family's overseas assignment. You can offer to help find a renter,
qualify them, and handle rental management while your client’s family is
overseas. Your CRM can help you manage your rental management tracking
needs.

Children’s needs are paramount in a PCS move, making school systems and
the school transition and registration process critical factors. Unlike
civilian families, military families do not always have the luxury of
relocating in the summer, when children are out of school. You should be
prepared to provide resources on local school district rankings, magnet
programs, and youth sports leagues.

Since the spouse is leaving their existing support network, your service
should include connecting them with local military family organizations,
such as base Family Readiness Groups (FRGs) or Spouse Clubs. By
providing this “soft landing” support, you alleviate the immense stress
of relocation and earn the family’s trust and long-term loyalty.

When both spouses are active-duty service members, the logistical
demands of buying or selling a home are uniquely compounded. Their
military schedules are often inflexible and may include simultaneous
deployments, extended training periods, or staggered move dates. This
can leave neither service member available to attend the closing or even
view the final property. As the agent, you must be prepared to use Power
of Attorney (POA) documents for tasks such as contract signing, loan
closings, and final walk-throughs. Because military POAs can have
specific expiration or usage limits, coordinate closely with your
VA-specialized title company to verify the document’s validity well in
advance. In these transactions, the ability to execute quickly and
flawlessly with remote tools is essential to success.

Veterans who have separated or retired have different needs from
active-duty families. When assisting this group, the main priorities are
often access to healthcare and community connection. Many veterans rely
on the VA healthcare system, so proximity to a VA Medical Center (VAMC)
or a major VA clinic is often a key consideration. When guiding your
buyer’s home search, research the nearest VA Medical Center and discuss
commute times and local VA services. Retired military families often
prefer to live near military bases for the community they provide, as
well as other benefits such as discounted shopping.

Additionally, veterans often seek communities with strong veteran
organizations—such as the VFW, the American Legion, or local veteran-run
social clubs—to preserve camaraderie and a sense of belonging. By
including proximity to these resources in your home search criteria, you
further demonstrate your commitment to being a military-friendly agent.

NAR also offers a Military Relocation Professional (MRP) certification
course you might consider. You can also use this coursework toward your
continuing education credits. Keep track of your continuing education
requirements and the classes you’ve completed by recording them in your
real estate CRM’s **education tracking** feature.

If this is a niche you want to focus on, there are many ways to reach
this target audience. Check with local Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW)
and American Legion chapters. If there’s a nearby base, the base housing
office can also be a resource. Additionally, many military-specific
websites, such as MilitaryByOwner, serve the housing needs of military
families.

Your marketing efforts should focus heavily on education: host free
webinars and create blog content that directly addresses military
financial benefits and logistical challenges, including “Mastering the
PCS Timeline” and “Avoiding VA Loan Closing Delays.”

Within the military community, the agent-client relationship demands a
level of trust rarely seen in traditional real estate. Military families
often face unpredictable orders and tight deadlines. They frequently
need to make purchasing decisions from thousands of miles away,
sometimes relying on an agent to serve as their eyes, ears, and
on-the-ground representative. As a result, agents who are Veterans or
military spouses have a natural, immediate advantage, sharing experience
and cultural understanding that help them empathize with the stress of a
PCS. In the end, the agent who earns the client’s confidence is the one
who demonstrates transparency, stays organized, and shows that they
prioritize the family’s stability over the commission.

The sacrifices made by military families, including frequent moves,
interrupted careers, family separation during deployment, and the
inherent risks of service, are part of the challenges of military life.
When the client entrusts you with their housing during a Permanent
Change of Station (PCS), they are asking you to stabilize the one area
of their lives the military does not control: their home and family
life. Your job is to honor this sacrifice by working with military
precision, complete transparency, and unwavering integrity.

## Short Sales

A short sale occurs when a property sells for less than the outstanding
mortgage balance. In this situation, the homeowner is underwater and
won’t receive any proceeds from the sale. The homeowner must obtain the
mortgage note holder’s acceptance of a loss for the difference between
the sale price and the loan payoff amount. Short sales require
additional effort and time from everyone involved and typically result
in a lower sale price than a conventional sale. This lower price helps
offset the buyer’s inconvenience. Your real estate CRM will help you
track the progress of a short sale.


If you decide to list an underwater transaction, your real estate CRM
can help you manage these challenges. You will need to coordinate with
the noteholder company to document financial hardship. The noteholder
must first approve a short sale, which is likely to involve
time-consuming back-and-forth. By documenting each communication and
placing the loan’s owner on a touch cycle, you can manage this process
with minimal strain. Assuming this step is complete, you can then list
the property. The listing description in your MLS must state that the
deal is a short sale. Because a short sale is considered a distressed
sale, you should expect lowball offers from buyers.

You can use your CRM to track the status of each offer. Because
acceptance requires approval from both the seller and the noteholders,
negotiations are typically prolonged and require significant follow-up
on your part. Use your CRM to track offers and deadlines, and set up a
touch cycle for each party to keep everyone in the loop. It is all too
easy for one party to be unresponsive, requiring you to follow up
repeatedly.

In a traditional transaction, inspections and appraisals are usually
done in parallel. However, in a short sale, the process must follow a
specific order. The last thing you want is to have the termite
inspection done too early, only to be forced to repeat it 60 days later
when the house is ready to close because the original inspection has
expired. You can use the contingencies tracking feature in your real
estate CRM to monitor your contingencies and their deadlines, along with
the inspection reports, including when they were completed and when they
expire.

It’s crucial to identify potential points of failure—such as noteholder
approval, inspection issues, buyer loan approval, and appraisals—to
reduce the risk of the deal falling apart. The last thing you want is
for the buyer to lose patience and back out at the last minute.

There are numerous disadvantages to accepting a short sale as either the
buyer's agent or the listing agent. These deals are more likely to fail.
They are also more time-consuming and can be aggravating because more
people need to approve the deal. But there are also advantages. Short
sales are more common when the economy is poor, in which case, for the
listing agent, a short sale listing is better than no listing at all. If
you represent the buyer, you should expect your client to secure a
better price than in a standard sale as compensation for the added
hassle and delays that a short sale entails.

One important due diligence step you must complete for all your listings
is to use the seller net calculator in your real estate CRM to determine
whether your listing is likely to become a short sale. This tells your
seller exactly how much money they will receive when the deal closes. In
many cases, this money is earmarked for the down payment on another
home; therefore, it is important that the seller understand precisely
how much down payment they will have remaining after accounting for loan
repayment, fees, and your commission.

Remember, the exact sale price cannot be predicted with precision
because the market determines the home’s final selling price. However,
it is important to identify when a listing could leave the seller owing
more than the home’s value. If the home is clearly underwater, it makes
sense to contact the noteholder immediately. If the home is underwater
and the sale price is only slightly below the asking price, that creates
a dilemma. The noteholder may be hesitant to agree to a slightly
underwater deal, and the seller might be reluctant to accept a lower
sale price, knowing that they would have to bring money to the closing
table. Both factors increase the likelihood that the deal will fall
through. Spotting these problems early will save you time in the long
run.

Understanding the seller’s motivation is helpful. Are they having
difficulty making payments? Did they lose their job? For a bank to
approve a short sale, the seller must demonstrate financial hardship. If
a seller is underwater but not experiencing economic hardship, the bank
will likely expect the seller to bring the necessary funds to closing to
pay off the mortgage. This is a step few sellers are willing to take.

One of the biggest risks for the agent in a short sale is the
uncertainty about whether they will earn your full commission. Because
the noteholder is accepting a loss on the loan, they can unilaterally
reduce the commission paid to both the listing and buyer’s agents below
what was agreed in the listing contract. The listing agent must obtain
the noteholder’s written approval of the commission amount (usually a
percentage of the final sale price) before allowing the buyer to spend
money on inspections and appraisals. If the noteholder proposes a
reduction, the agent must be prepared to accept the lower fee or risk
the bank rejecting the entire short-sale package. This financial risk is
a key reason many agents avoid these transactions.

If you represent the buyer in a short sale, your strategy should focus
on presenting the cleanest, most hassle-free offer to the note holder.
This includes encouraging your client to submit a strong, non-contingent
pre-approval letter (preferably from a local lender who can close
quickly) and proposing a swift closing timeline once the bank approves
the short sale. The bank’s goal is to approve the highest, cleanest net
offer with the least effort. Importantly, the buyer must exercise
patience, as the bank approval process can take months and often
involves extended periods of silence. The buyer’s agent must use their
CRM to manage the buyer’s expectations, providing regular (even if
minimal) updates to prevent the buyer from losing confidence and walking
away.

As a listing agent, you’re not obligated to accept every listing that
comes your way. You should evaluate the likelihood of closing the deal
and earning commissions. If the chances of success are low, it’s smarter
to refer the seller to another agent. You can then receive a referral
fee from the agent when the house sells.

No seller wants to go through the process of listing their home only to
see the deal fall through. If you suspect the agreement may result in an
underwater transaction, it’s essential to have an honest conversation
with the seller. Your real estate CRM can help you avoid listing a
property that won’t close.

## Real Estate Seminars

Many Americans dream of owning a home. They enjoy the financial benefits
of long-term appreciation, better school options, and the freedom to
make a space their own[20]. There are also lifestyle benefits, such as
space for a garden and a fenced yard for a dog. Yet for some people, the
path to homeownership is unclear. As a real estate professional, you are
always looking for ways to reach prospects who might not otherwise
contact you and to show them how attainable homeownership is.


One of the most effective ways to do this is to host an educational
seminar. These events let you guide first-time buyers who don’t
understand the process or help retirees explore options such as
downsizing or relocating closer to family and healthcare. You can also
focus on specific challenges, such as credit repair, and provide
step-by-step plans for people who may not think they qualify for a loan.
By addressing their concerns directly, you establish yourself as a
trusted advisor from the outset.

To attract motivated attendees, your seminar should provide targeted,
relevant information. This could include concrete steps for credit
repair or a list of the specific tax benefits of homeownership. You
might also present a rent vs. own analysis based on current market
conditions. Additionally, you could review the financial benefits of
downsizing. In each case, you could display accurate sample data during
the seminar and offer private, individualized consultations in which
attendees’ actual information can be analyzed. This would allow you to
work one-on-one with each prospect and is the perfect call to action for
the seminar.

You can add even more value by partnering with a mortgage broker who
explains how buyers can get pre-qualified for a loan, what down payment
requirements apply, and which loan programs are available. They can also
shighlight why a strong credit score matters and how reducing debts,
such as car or student loan payments, improves eligibility. From there,
you can step in to describe the character of different neighborhoods,
the long-term appreciation potential of homeownership, the tax benefits,
the quality of local schools, and other intangible benefits.

By working with another professional, you can address specific topics in
greater depth in ways that are uniquely valuable. For example, when
working with a financial planner, you can both emphasize opportunities
to use real estate for portfolio diversification and estate management.
You could also partner with tax professionals, such as CPAs, to cover
topics including the tax benefits of owning rental properties. This way,
you can tap into the client list of the tax professional and give them
an opportunity to guide their clients toward real estate investments
that minimize their tax burden. These are advanced topics that a real
estate agent might not otherwise address.

You could partner with a local independent living facility to discuss
the benefits of downsizing, with special emphasis on cost comparisons
and the simplicity of living in an adult community, where expenses such
as internet, electricity, trash collection, and property taxes are
included in the lease. This means fewer bills to pay, less hassle, and
overall cost savings. Not to mention the no longer needing to mow the
lawn, shovel snow, or do repairs and maintenance.

Once your seminar content is ready, you’ll need to fill the room.
Distributing flyers in upscale apartment buildings can reach renters
open to change. Targeted ads on platforms like Facebook let you focus on
geographic and demographic groups most likely to buy. Bridal shows can
also connect you with couples preparing to buy their first home. If
you’re partnering with another professional, they can promote the
seminar to their clients, extending your reach even further. Throughout
the event, you can reinforce your role as a trusted real estate advisor
by guiding clients through the purchase process and helping them
understand the protections in place to ensure a safe, transparent
home-buying experience.

The perceived value of your seminar is closely tied to its setting.
Avoid small, crowded meeting rooms and choose venues that project
professionalism and comfort. Consider partnering with a local bank,
title company, independent living facility, or community center that
offers a clean, well-equipped space at no or low cost. Timing matters:
evening events (6:30 PM - 8:00 PM) are ideal for working professionals,
while Saturday morning sessions are better suited to families. Always
provide light refreshments such as coffee, water, and perhaps a baked
good, and ensure professional-grade audio-visual equipment. Paying
attention to these details enhances the value of your advice and helps
elevate your brand beyond basic sales pitches.


> **Realtor Roots Secret:** A great parting gift is to give your prospects your business card taped to a packet of seeds. This is a subtle reminder that owning a home means that you can enjoy planting flowers, having a vegetable garden, or just sitting under a shade tree with a cool beverage.


Your real estate CRM can collect contact information from conference
attendees. The ideal pretext for collecting a phone number and email
address is to offer a value-added item via email. For example, you could
provide a PDF of your presentation slides so attendees don’t need to
take notes. To eliminate data entry on your end, you can use the open
house form or the call capture feature built into your CRM.

To maintain a steady flow of new leads, treat seminars as recurring
events rather than one-time efforts. Plan to host an event at least
semi-annually, timing it strategically around periods of high interest,
such as early spring or late fall. If your topic focuses on tax
benefits, schedule your seminar around April 15th, when taxes are due.

Maximize the value of seminar leads by following up promptly. Use your
real estate CRM to add attendees to a drip email sequence, with the
first email delivering the promised item of value. An ideal
Call-to-Action (CTA) is to offer a free consultation tailored to your
prospect’s specific needs. Reach out by phone or text to stay in
contact. Many seminar attendees will be uncertain, and it may take weeks
or even months for them to decide to move forward.

## Commercial Real Estate

Any agent with a real estate license can sell both residential and
commercial properties. If you’re looking to focus on a market where you
can earn more with fewer deals, commercial real estate is a strong
option. There are fewer agents competing there, and the average deal
size is much larger.

There are also a few disadvantages — the commercial real estate market
can be difficult to enter, with only a few agents controlling most of
it. Your MLS lists some smaller commercial properties, but many are
listed on other sites, such as CityFeet and LoopNet. You should not
treat commercial real estate as an either-or proposition. Instead, I
recommend considering that some of your residential clients may need a
trusted real estate professional for a small commercial transaction, in
addition to their regular residential needs. In that case, it would make
sense to consider you for that task. 

You can use your real estate CRM to track your commercial buyers,
including their needs and contact information. Additionally, the homes
database, also known as the properties database, can be used to monitor
commercial properties for sale. This is useful because there is often no
single centralized location where all commercial properties are listed.

Leasing is a major part of the commercial market. If you’re interested
in entering the commercial market, you’ll likely need to handle both
leasing and sales. Again, your real estate CRM can help you track rental
deals just as well as sales.

Unlike residential real estate, where marketing relies primarily on
digital ads and open houses, the commercial market depends on active
networking and referrals. You should be prepared to consistently engage
with professionals involved in commercial deals: commercial lenders,
land use attorneys, CPAs, and economic development officials. Join and
actively participate in professional organizations such as the Certified
Commercial Investment Member (CCIM) or Commercial Real Estate Women
(CREW) to build trust and gain vital market knowledge. Your main goal is
to be part of the team responsible for achieving your client's goals.
Leads may come from Certified Public Accountants (CPA) whose clients
need a 1031 exchange, or from bankers whose borrowers need to sell a
property quickly.

### Zahid Moghal

Toronto real estate agent Zahid Moghal was left looking for a new path
after his partnership as a residential agent dissolved. He found that
the path led him to commercial real estate, but upon transitioning, he
noticed stark differences. “The deals were a lot more complex,” Zahid
said, “And the deals would take longer, so long in fact that juggling
multiple deals at once was the new normal.” Zahid needed to adapt his
approach to keep up, but he didn’t want to lose revenue by taking time
to migrate to a new CRM. Instead, he adapted his workflow to commercial
real estate and realized how universal a real estate CRM can be. Zahid
said, “Residential and commercial real estate have more similarities
than differences. The biggest similarity is that people make deals with
those they trust, and trust is built by being reliable”. Zahid believes
that while you do need a good CRM, success in real estate comes from how
you use that CRM.

—«◊»—

A key difference in commercial real estate is the transaction timeline.
Be prepared for deals to take six months to a year, or longer, to close,
especially when financing, zoning, or environmental due diligence is
complex. This requires a significant financial runway and a different
mindset than in the residential market, where deals typically close in
one or two months. Your marketing to prospective clients must reflect
this by highlighting thorough due diligence and expertise in managing
the entire process, including Environmental Assessments and complex
lease negotiations. Because you close fewer deals, your clients’
financial stability and the thoroughness of the contract are crucial.
Your long-term marketing strategy should focus on building relationships
over years, not weeks.

Because commercial deals can last for months and involve detailed
financial reviews, the closing process is often more complex than in
residential transactions. Using your CRM is essential to manage this
extensive due diligence. Use your CRM to track every
contingency—including securing appropriate financing (often complex
commercial loans), completing Phase I Environmental Assessments,
securing municipal zoning and permit approvals, and reviewing detailed
tenant leases. Your CRM can also monitor critical deadlines and ensure
documents are sent to the right people at the right time. You can use
the parties section of your transaction management system to track
inspectors, loan officers, city officials, and others involved in the
approval process.

Your contacts database should include Commercial Lenders (specializing
in bridge loans, SBA loans, and portfolio lending); Specialized
Inspectors (covering Phase I Environmental Assessments, structural
engineering, and ADA compliance); and Legal/Accounting Experts (CPAs
specializing in 1031 exchanges and attorneys focused on land use,
zoning, and tenant law). You should also maintain connections with local
zoning and planning departments, economic development offices, and
utility providers. Understanding this regulatory “red tape” and having
direct access to these key public and private contacts enable you to
navigate complex contingencies and de-risk the transaction for the
investor.

While large institutional brokerages often dominate metropolitan
commercial markets, the situation in small cities and tertiary markets
is different. In these areas, there are typically fewer agents, making
the market less competitive. Transactions tend to be smaller, and deals
are generally less liquid.

In this environment, an agent’s greatest advantage is local knowledge.
Major commercial listing services like LoopNet may be incomplete, so
local deals are sometimes off-market or uncovered through close-knit
networks with local business owners, banks, and the town’s planning
department. A successful small-market agent relies less on national data
and more on localized, ground-level information—such as knowing a local
business owner’s retirement plans. For this reason, a top marketing
priority in tertiary markets is consistent in-person networking,
including regular attendance at local Chamber of Commerce meetings,
municipal planning board sessions, and business association events.

The commercial market often requires agents to proactively prospect by
contacting property owners about properties that are not currently
listed for sale. Agents can use public tax records to create targeted
lists of commercial property owners. You can import this information
into your CRM using the valet import feature, then use the click-to-dial
function in your CRM to call business owners and find out whether they
have considered selling. The **click-to-dial** feature significantly
speeds up the process by allowing you to call someone from your mobile
phone by clicking a link in your CRM on your computer. It can
significantly accelerate calling multiple people in succession. After
speaking with your prospect, add notes to your database and schedule a
follow-up call as part of your touch cycle.

Prospecting for commercial buyers can be done in a few ways. You could
identify gatekeepers, such as attorneys and CPAs, who may have
high-net-worth clients interested in a commercial investment
opportunity. These professionals often understand the tax benefits of
commercial real estate and will recommend investments that minimize
their clients' tax burden.

You can also identify professionals who might benefit from commercial
investment, such as dentists and doctors, and contact each one
individually to gauge their interest in these opportunities. For larger
investments, such as a large apartment complex, you might be able to
organize a pool of investors to share the risk.

Unlike residential real estate, commercial brokerage relies heavily on
an intensive apprenticeship model. Because transactions are highly
complex, errors can cost clients millions, making it nearly impossible
for a newcomer to succeed without dedicated, experienced guidance. An
agent entering this field should focus on joining a successful
commercial team or a brokerage that offers a formal mentorship program.
The mentor provides essential oversight of due diligence, lease
negotiations, and complex financial analysis. This relationship enables
the new agent to learn from deals, build credibility through
association, and gain access to off-market listings, significantly
reducing the time needed to become proficient. An agent should plan to
dedicate their first 1-2 years entirely to learning and supporting their
mentor’s book of business.

Although there are commercial real estate-specific CRMs, these products
are typically less advanced than those designed for residential agents.
Prices for commercial CRMs are also significantly higher. For these
reasons, it is not unusual for commercial agents to use a CRM primarily
dedicated to residential real estate for their commercial business.
