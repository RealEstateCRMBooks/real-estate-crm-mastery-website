# Further Reading

This book, *Real Estate CRM Mastery*, is designed for the experienced
agent who has mastered the essentials and is ready to scale their
production. It covers advanced strategies for managing your time,
automating your marketing, and leading a team or an assistant. I have
also written a companion book, *Real Estate CRM Secrets*, which focuses
on the fundamental systems a new agent needs to get organized, develop
consistent habits, and build their business. Together, these two books
offer a complete, repeatable system for transforming a new agent into a
top-producing real estate professional.
