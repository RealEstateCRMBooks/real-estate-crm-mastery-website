—Dirk Zeller, *Success as a Real Estate Agent For Dummies*

Experienced agents know that listings are the foundation of their
business. In this chapter, I will show you how to use a single listing
as a marketing flywheel to generate more transactions. First, you’ll
learn to track listing opportunities with a structured CRM-based
process. Next, you’ll discover how to generate leads through yard signs,
flyers, and call capture with CRM integrations. Finally, you’ll learn
how to prepare for the closing process and what actions to take for your
client after closing. By the end of this chapter, you’ll understand how
to use your CRM at each stage of the listing journey, from acquisition
to post-closing follow-up.

## Getting Listings

OK, so through your diligent prospecting, you’ve secured a listing
appointment. Now what? A listing appointment gets your foot in the door.
However, you’re almost certainly competing with other agents, and the
seller may have objections or hesitations. Your goal during the
appointment is to help the seller choose you as their listing agent.
Your success isn’t guaranteed, but with careful planning, you can
significantly increase your odds. The first step is to send a
professional pre-listing package to the seller’s home before the
appointment. This small gesture demonstrates your commitment and helps
you stand out. To make a memorable impression, drive by the home
beforehand to take a photo. Using a label printer like a Dymo, print the
photo of their home directly onto the label for the front of the
package. This detail shows you’re already focused on their specific
property. The package should be stored in a high-quality folder, along
with a few of your business cards, a branded pen, and a sample listing
agreement.


> **The Property Picture Secret:** Before delivering your pre-listing package, drive by the seller’s home and take a photo of it. Print the photo on the label for the front of the package. This demonstrates you’ve done your homework and appreciate the uniqueness of the property for sale.


Based on your past experience, create a “Listing Acquisition” Task Plan.
This is the list of tasks you need to complete to maximize your chances
of becoming the listing agent. Once the appointment is scheduled, launch
this plan to automate your pre-listing workflow. Tasks should include:
“Take Drive-by Photo,” “Print Branded Pre-Listing Folder,” “Run Seller
Net Calculation,” and “Pull Comparable Properties.” This ensures every
detail is executed consistently, allowing you to focus on building
rapport and handling objections during the meeting.

The pre-listing package must be carefully curated to generate interest
and demonstrate your credentials. Include a personalized cover letter
that highlights your competitive advantages. Add your professional
biography and details about your brokerage. Showcase your deep
understanding of the local market with materials such as walkability
scores and school rankings. A key element is a professionally designed
marketing brochure. This document justifies your commission by clearly
outlining the specific, high-impact activities you will undertake to
sell the home. Detail your syndication strategy across major real estate
websites, your social media promotion plan, and the benefits of the MLS.
Highlight your high-touch services, such as professional photography,
drone footage, 3D walkthroughs, and video tours. Consider creating
tiered marketing packages. Reserve premium services, such as hiring a
contractor to produce professional floor plans, for higher-end listings.
This demonstrates a tailored approach and helps clients understand the
value you offer. Strategically, omit two items from this package: first,
exclude the Comparative Market Analysis (CMA); second, exclude a general
market conditions report. The goal of the package is to secure an
in-person meeting to discuss pricing and strategy in detail.

You can handle the listing appointment using either a one-step or a
two-step process. A one-step appointment combines the home viewing and
your presentation into a single visit. However, a two-step process is
often more effective. The first step is a preliminary visit to tour the
home and build essential rapport. Most importantly, use this time to
understand the seller’s underlying motivations. Let them be the star of
the conversation. Ask why they are selling. Is it a divorce, a job
transfer, or an upgrade? Do they have a specific timeline? Will they be
living in the home while it is for sale? Understanding whether their
priority is the highest possible price or the speed of the sale is
crucial for framing your entire strategy. Your CRM is the perfect tool
for logging these critical notes during or immediately after this
initial conversation.

The second step is the formal listing presentation, where you present
your data-driven strategy. Instead of a single, detailed presentation, I
recommend three separate, easy-to-understand documents. The first is a
Market Condition Report that summarizes current market trends for the
selling season and can be updated monthly and reused across all
listings. The second is a Services Offered document, a brief summary of
your services that serves as a handy leave-behind. The third is the CMA,
tailored to the seller’s property and generated using fresh data from
your MLS. Be prepared with the listing contract ready for signing.
Saving this analysis in the client’s record creates a lasting record of
your initial pricing advice, serving as a helpful reference for future
adjustments as market conditions change.


> **The Proper Price Secret:** A CMA is useful, but nothing establishes a realistic price better than seeing the competition firsthand. After showing your seller the data, take them on a tour of the top three competing homes on the market. This gives them a buyer’s-eye view and makes your pricing recommendation seem more aligned with market reality.


Your presentation style should be interactive. A brief back-and-forth
helps you identify any objections the seller may have. Your ability to
identify and address these barriers directly is crucial to securing the
listing. During the meeting, walk the seller through the CMA to
determine a recommended price range. To make the analysis tangible,
identify the top three homes a buyer would likely see besides the
seller's own. Before setting a final price, offer to show your seller
the Seller Net Sheet from your CRM to provide a clear financial picture
of the cash they will receive from the sale of their property.

Your listing presentation has one goal: turning a prospect into a
client. By using your real estate CRM to track every step, you can
deliver a consistent presentation to each client. A systematic approach
makes you look professional and organized, leaving nothing to chance
when managing your client’s most valuable asset. This methodical
execution, powered by your CRM, ultimately boosts your chances of
closing the deal and builds a strong foundation for a successful
transaction grounded in trust.

## Listing Management

Immediately after the contract is signed, you can create a listing
record in your CRM, which automatically triggers the task plan for your
new listing. This plan manages the transition to active marketing. Tasks
would typically include: “Get Key from Seller,” “Make Copy of Key,”
“Install Sign and Lockbox,” “Schedule Photos,” “Update MLS,” “Update
Zillow,” “Create Flyer Design,” and so on. Using a task plan minimizes
the risk of missing a step, accelerates time-to-market, and provides
your client with a consistent, professional experience from day one.

As a trusted advisor, you need to provide specific, actionable guidance
on how best to prepare the property for sale. This includes
decluttering, removing personal photos, and increasing light bulb
wattage to make rooms feel brighter. Be honest about sensory details,
such as odors from smoking or pets, that can kill a deal[42]. Emphasize
curb appeal by making sure that the yard is well-maintained. You can
advise on furniture placement, drawing on your experience and Feng Shui
principles to create a more harmonious flow. Provide clear guidance on
any repairs or improvements that would enhance the property’s
salability. In most cases, it is wise to repair what is broken and, at
most, apply a coat of paint. For older homes, recommend a home warranty
to improve the property’s competitiveness. Finally, manage practical
details, such as providing booties for visitors and documenting
conveyances in your CRM to prevent disputes.

A new listing is also a powerful tool for generating new business. Use
it as a reason to reconnect with past clients in the area by dropping by
with a flyer. At the same time, walk the neighborhood to hand out flyers
and send “just listed” postcards to nearby homes. Throughout the
process, your communication is key. As real estate author Dirk Zeller
states, “The number one complaint sellers have about their agents is a
lack of communication.” Proactive, consistent communication is vital for
keeping your seller satisfied and engaged. Providing real-time feedback
from showings, other agents, and prospective buyers is crucial to
managing your listing. This steady flow of information helps justify
strategic changes, such as price adjustments, by grounding them in
direct market feedback rather than your opinion alone.

Open houses are valuable for gathering direct, unbiased feedback from
potential buyers. This firsthand insight is a powerful tool for refining
your sales approach. They also provide objective data to share with your
seller, especially when discussing possible price adjustments. Although
some agents question their effectiveness in direct sales, experts like
Gary Keller view open houses as a key lead-generation activity. Their
purpose is twofold: to find a buyer for the property and to connect with
other potential buyers and sellers in the neighborhood. My book, *Real
Estate CRM Secrets*, provides an exhaustive, step-by-step system for
running an open house to maximize lead capture.


> **QR Code Secret:** A great way to strengthen your pre-listing package is to add a QR code that links to a landing page for sellers. This page can provide a brief video introduction, client testimonials, and a gallery of your past work. It’s a modern way to make a strong impression and give sellers a preview of your expertise before you even meet.


The transaction management features of your real estate CRM help you
manage your listings from a signed listing agreement through closing.
The benefit of using a CRM is that it systematizes the process, ensuring
you deliver a consistent level of service for each listing. Without the
transaction management features in your CRM, there’s a higher risk of
missing important details. Your CRM also allows you to scale your
efforts to manage multiple listings and closings simultaneously.

Finally, by organizing your efforts systematically, you become better at
identifying which parts of this process can be delegated to an assistant
or partner. Using the multi-user features of your CRM, you can still
oversee the entire process. This second level of scaling offers the
greatest opportunities to increase your total income, as you can
leverage your capabilities far beyond what you might accomplish without
a real estate CRM.

You should use your CRM’s ability to upload files to securely store all
critical listing documents, including the signed listing agreement, all
seller disclosures (e.g., lead-based paint, property condition forms),
and document any conveyances. Centralizing these files in your CRM makes
them easily accessible from anywhere, so you can work from the office,
at home, or at an open house. You can also easily send the files to
other parties, such as a buyer agent or the closing company.

By using the open house form and call-capture features in your CRM, you
can create a visitor log that shows who has seen the property and their
feedback. You can share this information with your client using the
service report feature of your CRM. Over time, this feedback will help
you and your client form an opinion about how competitive the property
is compared with similar homes for sale in the same neighborhood and at
a similar price. Issues can then be addressed based on feedback,
enabling you to advise the seller with data rather than just your
intuition.

You should set up a touch-cycle task with your seller to maintain
regular communication. Your client is likely eager for updates, and your
ability to keep them informed will go a long way toward reducing the
stress they are likely feeling.

By sharing a service report link with your seller, you give them a
real-time overview of the listing’s status, including completed and
planned promotions, showings, and feedback. It also lists offers,
completed tasks, and the parties involved in the transaction so far.
This link gives your seller a clear view of activity around their home.
As photos are taken, the sign is posted, the listing appears on MLS and
Zillow, and open houses are scheduled, each event is documented in the
report. If you don’t receive an offer within the first few months, you
can use the service report as the basis for a conversation about a price
adjustment or changes that might make the house more salable.

Use your CRM to track the listing’s expiration date. While you might
receive an all-cash offer that first weekend, be prepared for the
possibility that it does not sell by the listing agreement deadline.
Your CRM helps you understand your timeframe, enabling you to prepare
your seller for a potential price adjustment and, if necessary, an
extension of the listing agreement. The last thing you want is for three
months to pass and for you to forget the listing agreement's expiration
date!

## Yard Signs

Yard signs are among your top marketing tools. They help you establish
your presence in a neighborhood, attract leads from people interested in
buying a home, and connect you with buyers who might be interested in
other homes for sale. There are several ways to enhance your yard signs
to maximize their impact. Several days before the open house, add an
open house **sign rider** to inform passersby of the date and time. A
sign rider is a smaller sign that attaches to the main “For Sale” yard
sign to provide additional details. On the day of your open house, add
balloons to the sign and post directional signs to guide traffic to the
open house. Don’t forget to add a call capture rider if you are using
that feature in your CRM. If your seller is offering a home warranty,
that’s also a great sign rider opportunity. You can use your CRM to
track which sign riders you have installed, so you can maximize their
impact.


What about a **flyer box**? Once common, its popularity has declined
because installing one can decrease your call volume. Someone who picks
up a flyer might decide the home isn’t a good fit and never calls,
costing you a potential lead. That’s the main argument against placing a
flyer outside the home. On the other hand, the argument for flyers is
that neighbors and others who may not be personally interested in buying
might pick one up and pass it to someone they know who could be
interested. Since the flyer is a tangible item, it’s easier to obtain
and share than other formats. This is especially helpful during an open
house. I recommend a compromise: include an open house flyer in the box
a few days before the open house. The flyer invites people to visit the
home during the open house. For listings, a practical approach is to
leave the price off your printed flyer. That way, a prospect still needs
to use your call capture number to find out the price.

You should also walk around the neighborhood, knock on neighbors’ doors,
and distribute open house invitations. That would go a long way toward
building your presence. Again, the goal is to create awareness that you
are the expert in that neighborhood. If anyone is looking to buy or
sell, they should contact you. You can help find a buyer for that
listing. You might also bump into someone in the neighborhood who is
interested in selling their home. I recommend mentioning that you can
conduct a comparable market analysis—something like, “Home prices have
really gone up recently. Have you considered seeing what your home is
worth?” That could help you eliminate PMI or get a home equity loan.


> **Solar Sign Secret:** To increase your yard sign’s visibility after dark, use a solar-powered or timer-controlled light. This detail is important because serious buyers are likely to drive through neighborhoods after work hours to evaluate the home’s nighttime appearance and curb appeal.


The quality and size of your yard sign reflect your professional brand,
so consider investing in a sturdy wood post rather than a simple metal
frame. To boost nighttime visibility, use a solar-powered or
timer-controlled light on your sign. This detail is crucial because
serious buyers often drive through neighborhoods after work hours to
assess nighttime curb appeal. Additionally, advise your sellers to keep
their porch and exterior lights on throughout the evening for the same
reason: a well-lit home appears more welcoming and attractive. Consider
multiple yard signs if the back and side yards face a street. For
example, a corner lot or a lot that abuts a street in the back. Your CRM
can remind you when to put up and take down your yard sign, when to
change your flyers, and when to put up and take down your sign rider for
the open house.

### Glen Hagen

In a competitive real estate market like Long Island, New York, Glen
Hagen of Realty Connect USA learned how to be relentless. Before his
career in real estate, Glen honed his negotiation skills at major media
companies, including Paramount, MGM, and Viacom, where he sold TV shows
to networks and negotiated multimillion-dollar deals. “I learned from
some of the best negotiators in the business,” he says. “Now, I use
those same skills to close deals other agents can’t.” While his
negotiation skills are sharp, he still needs to identify counterparties.
Which is why he says, “It all comes down to looking for people who want
to buy or sell real estate - and do it with me,” Glen explains. “I can’t
wait for them to call me. I have to find them.” In his client hunt, he
began using his CRM systematically, keeping time-stamped notes and
caller details, and scheduling follow-up tasks, enabling Glen to turn
inquiries into leads. Even if a caller doesn’t commit right away, Glen’s
system ensures they’re added to his CRM database, organized by category
and follow-up stage. But this level of follow-up can wear on someone.
While a “no” could turn to a “yes” tomorrow, it could also just stay a
“no”. When Glen thinks of that, he responds with a smile, “Some will,
some won’t, so what? You move on.” Glen Hagen’s strongest trait is his
persistence in negotiations, and he uses his CRM and his system to
provide him with enough people to negotiate with.

Call capture offers several advantages over simply listing your mobile
number on your yard sign. The key advantage is that prospects are more
likely to call or text an automated helpline. Some prospects may
hesitate to speak with a pushy agent or feel uncomfortable calling late
at night. Automated call capture technology addresses both objections.
Because the system operates 24/7, you can gather new leads even while
you sleep. It can also collect a phone number and caller ID information
without any input from you or the prospect. Even if someone hangs up,
you still have their contact details.

## Flyers

Flyers have been a staple of real estate marketing since the invention
of the printing press. Agents often create a standard 8.5” x 11” flyer
for distribution at open houses, placing it on a kitchen counter inside
the home or displaying it in a flyer box attached to the yard sign.
These materials are inexpensive and easy to produce with a personal
printer or at a local print shop.

Beyond traditional uses, flyers can serve more targeted, strategic
purposes. For example, embedding a flyer image in an email is an
effective way to conduct reverse prospecting. This strategy uses your
MLS to identify agents with saved searches that match your new listing.
You would then email your flyer to these agents and include a note such
as, “I believe this house is a perfect match for one of your clients.”
This proactive, laser-focused approach can generate immediate interest
from agents already working with qualified buyers.

A key strategic decision is whether to include pricing on your flyers.
Although price is the most requested detail, leaving it off flyers can
be a powerful lead-generation tool. Prospects who take a flyer might
decide the home isn’t for them and never call back. However, if they
need to contact you for pricing, you create an opportunity to connect.
By directing them to a call-capture number, you can provide the
information they need while collecting their phone number for follow-up.

Texting an image of the flyer in response is always a good idea. This
approach turns a curious passerby into a captured lead whom you can
assist with other properties. An additional benefit is that priceless
flyers are evergreen, saving you the cost of reprinting after a price
reduction. Of course, the price is less of an issue if you are handing
out flyers in person, where including it is perfectly acceptable.


> **Flyer Funnel Secret:** Don’t include the price on your flyers. Instead, tell them they can get the current price by texting a three-digit code to your call capture phone number. This way, you avoid the need to update your flyers when the price changes, and you also automatically collect contact information in your CRM from anyone who calls.


A well-executed flyer is a strong testament to your abilities as an
agent. It is a tangible marketing tool you can give a seller to show
your dedication to presenting their home in the best light. These flyers
become part of your professional portfolio; you can reference them
during listing presentations to demonstrate the quality and consistency
of your work. Additionally, each flyer offers an opportunity to
strengthen your personal brand. By including your company logo and a
professional portrait, you create a cohesive, memorable image that
clients associate with quality and expertise.

For execution, your real estate CRM is the most efficient tool for
creating professional flyers. A good CRM provides a library of
pre-designed templates, which is helpful because you can see a sample
before you begin. This lets you produce a polished flyer in minutes.
This speed is a key advantage, as many agents waste valuable time
perfecting custom designs. You don’t want to spend too much time fussing
over a flyer. Your time is better spent ensuring the content, such as
high-quality photos and engaging descriptions, is excellent. Since this
work should already be prepared for the MLS, creating the flyer is
simply a matter of filling in the template. Aim for good enough rather
than perfection. Your clients and prospects will not notice minor design
details.

A modern approach is to add a QR code (also known as a Quick Response
code) to your printed flyer. This QR code links to the online version’s
squeeze page of your flyer. From there, you can gather contact details,
offer a virtual tour, and share more photos and a floor plan. Expanding
your content beyond print allows you to include more information and
collect contact info more easily.

Many CRMs provide **flyer templates** with a designated space for QR
codes, making setup simple. While useful for printed flyers, QR codes
are less effective when emailing a flyer, as a clickable link works
better in that case.

While the printed flyer remains a useful and effective tool, its role
has evolved with the rise of the internet. Agents with their own
websites should consider creating a one-page online property listing for
each property, serving as an interactive digital flyer. 

A more direct evolution of the flyer box is the call capture system,
which offers significant strategic advantages over a traditional flyer
box. The primary benefit is lead generation. While a paper flyer
provides information anonymously, call capture instantly records the
potential buyer’s phone number in your CRM, enabling immediate
follow-up. Your prospect receives an electronic version of the flyer as
an automated response when calling the hotline. This turns a passive
sign into an active, 24/7 lead generator that captures contact
information from every interested party. It also eliminates the ongoing
task of refilling an empty flyer box. Additionally, it reduces printing
costs, making it a highly efficient, modern alternative for tech-savvy
agents. 

## Service Reports

A **service report** is a centralized record of all activities related
to a property listing. This includes feedback from showings, marketing
efforts, and updates on offers. Monitoring this activity gives the
seller a real-time view of progress toward a sale and objective data for
making pricing decisions. With a service report, you can update your
client on feedback from showings, such as a poorly maintained yard,
visible clutter, or a dangerous dog. You should also share the
promotional activities you have planned and completed. If the seller
lives in the home, they will already need to know when to leave for
showings and will naturally be curious about how the showings went. It’s
best to provide this feedback regularly and promptly.

Many professional CRMs deliver the service report as a live,
password-protected web link. This feature gives your client transparent,
24/7 access to real-time information about their listing. They can
review showing feedback, view completed promotional tasks, and
**document the status of offers**. While this automation provides data,
it does not replace your expert interpretation. I still recommend
placing your client on a weekly touch cycle. This proactive
communication addresses one of the most common friction points sellers
report: agent unresponsiveness. It reassures them that you are actively
promoting the listing. By maintaining a steady flow of information and
analysis, you reduce your client’s anxiety and lay the groundwork for
strategic conversations, such as a potential price adjustment if needed.

You can integrate your real estate CRM with electronic lockbox systems
to document each showing. Systems such as Sentrilock, Supra, and
BrokerBay send email notifications when a showing agent visits the
property. By directing these emails to a dedicated email address
provided by your CRM, the system parses the email and automatically
creates a showing entry in the listing record. The captured details
include the agent’s name, company, and date of the visit. This process
saves time, eliminates manual data entry in your CRM, and alerts you to
new showings. Most importantly, it provides your seller with a log of
property traffic in the service report. 

You can then request feedback from the showing agent by sending them a
**showing feedback form**. They simply select answers from drop-down
menus to answer simple questions about the buyer’s thoughts. This
feedback may be biased; for instance, no buyer will say the home is
priced too low. However, it can still help identify issues such as
aggressive pets, difficulty accessing the home, a cluttered interior,
and the property's competitiveness. The showing agent and the buyer are
likely visiting several properties simultaneously. As a result, they
will have a clearer sense of the home’s competitiveness than your seller
or even you. If you choose to gather feedback, do so within a few
minutes or, at the latest, a few hours after the showing. Your CRM can
include a photo of the property in the feedback form to help jog the
agent’s memory. Buyers and buyer agents see many properties in a row,
and after a few hours, everything tends to blend together. It’s unlikely
you’ll get accurate feedback even a day later.

Your real estate CRM lets you share a link to your service report that
updates in real time. When it comes to promotions, it’s smart to
document what you’re doing behind the scenes, such as updating Zillow,
presenting on Trulia, Homes.com, Facebook advertising, and Craigslist
promotions, among others. Naturally, you’ll also create a flyer, install
a yard sign and lockbox, and promote open houses, circle prospecting,
just-listed postcards, and possibly a broker open house. All these
efforts generate buzz and attract traffic. The sooner you attract
traffic, the sooner you’ll get feedback, and the sooner the home may
receive offers. Make sure the report details what’s planned, what’s
completed, and the timeline for each task.


> **Perfect Price Secret:** Use your service report to keep your seller informed of you marketing activities, showings, and showing feedback. If a price adjustment becomes necessary, let the feedback in the service report speak for itself.


Speaking of offers, the service report tracks offers, counteroffers, and
the negotiation process. Many clients don’t fully realize how much work
you do, and the service report is a great way to keep them informed. Use
the service report during offer strategy calls and bring a printed copy
to price-review meetings. After closing, archive the final service
report with your transaction file. This documentation also strengthens
your legal and tax recordkeeping later.

## Handling Closings

On your journey to closing a deal, the first major milestone is securing
a ratified contract. A contract is ratified when all parties agree to
and sign it, making the agreement legally binding. However, you don’t
get paid until the deal closes. The path from a ratified contract to a
completed closing is not guaranteed, and many issues can arise along the
way. For example, if the buyer’s financing falls through, the deal may
be canceled.

Most contracts include **contingencies**, conditions that must be
resolved before the deal can close. A common contingency is loan
approval. This process usually occurs in two steps. First, the buyer
must qualify for the loan amount. Typically, the buyer is pre-qualified,
which reduces uncertainty about final approval. The second step in loan
approval is an appraisal to confirm that the property’s value is at or
above the agreed-upon sale price.

Another common contingency is a home inspection. This is often used by
buyers who lack confidence in the home’s condition. Buyers may also
request specialized inspections for wells, septic systems, radon, and
structural issues, which can be included as contingencies depending on
the property’s features and condition.

Given the complexities of contingencies, many opportunities exist for a
deal to fall through. The buyer might not qualify for the loan, or the
inspection could reveal serious issues with the property. In either
case, if these are listed as contingencies in the contract, the buyer
can walk away from the deal and get their earnest money back. You should
use your CRM to document each contingency, its deadline, and progress
toward fulfillment. Any of these contingencies could cause the deal to
fail, so tracking each one can be the difference between getting paid
and walking away empty-handed.

Your job is to help move these contingencies across the finish line one
by one. This starts by adding the contact information for the loan
officer, inspectors, and any other **parties** required to complete due
diligence for each contingency to your CRM. You should also add any
scheduled appointments to your CRM’s calendar, such as **inspections**
or viewings. Sometimes, you might want to be present to answer questions
or provide access.

A report, such as an appraisal or inspection report, is usually
generated. You would provide that information to your client and address
any issues with the other real estate agent. For example, if an
inspector identified electrical issues, a common seller response would
be to either correct the problem or offer a price reduction to
compensate. Since this is a negotiation, it is important to document
each stage of the process in your CRM and in an addendum to the
contract. 

Certain contingencies also require careful timing. For example, a
termite inspection required for a loan must be completed within 30 days
of closing. If you do it too early and the closing is delayed, you’ll
need to arrange a second inspection. Another tricky contingency involves
HOA documents, which the buyer must review before closing.

You can use your CRM’s task plans to ensure each step is completed. Your
real estate CRM keeps you on track by displaying deadlines in your
calendar, such as the loan approval deadline, so you don’t miss them.

You need to maintain both the buyer’s and the seller's commitment to
close the deal, as either party might get cold feet during the process.
Using your real estate CRM to track progress lets you brief the other
agent and your client each week. You can also provide your client with a
service report summarizing all activity related to the deal. This is a
great way to keep your client up to date with live information without
having to call them constantly.

If the deal falls through, review other interested buyers. If you had
considered multiple offers, you might have designated one as a **backup
offer** and recorded it in the offers section of your CRM’s listing
record. Using your real estate CRM to track this helps you quickly
identify an alternative buyer and move forward.

**Conveyances** are items that stay with the house after it is sold.
Common sense holds that anything attached to the house remains unless
specifically excluded. For example, a chandelier usually stays with the
house, but a bathroom mirror might not. Your CRM can track conveyances.
Sometimes, there’s ambiguity, or the buyer or seller wants to make an
exception. Your CRM is a useful tool for keeping things clear. For
larger items, such as a washer and dryer, the contract should clearly
state the disposition of the items.


> **The Digital Defense Secret:** Protect yourself from legal liability after closing by documenting important details in your CRM. The easiest way to record every disclosure, client conversation, document, conveyance, and contingency is to log them in your CRM.


Throughout this process, you must carefully manage any funds entrusted
to you. When you accept an **earnest money deposit**, you assume
fiduciary responsibility. Mishandling these funds is a serious offense
that could result in the loss of your license. Use your real estate CRM
to record when you received the funds, the amount, and how they were
handled, whether given to the other agent, deposited into an escrow
account, or held for closing. This creates a digital paper trail that
demonstrates you have exercised your fiduciary duty responsibly.

As the closing approaches, your CRM becomes crucial for **tracking key
dates**. Enter the closing date, walkthrough appointment, and possession
date and time. While the close and possession dates are usually the
same, a delay can occur between them. These dates are so important that
you should sync them with your smartphone using Google Sync. That way,
they appear on your smartphone calendar as well as in your CRM. You will
likely attend both the walkthrough and the closing to avoid last-minute
issues. At closing, you will need to bring the key, handle the earnest
money check, pick up your commission check, and retrieve your lockbox.
Your CRM can help you keep track of each of these tasks.

While a standard transaction can be complex, some deals involve unique
circumstances, such as dual agency. This occurs when you represent
**both sides** of a transaction, for example, when a buyer from your
open house purchases the listing. Although you earn a double commission,
this situation can create a potential conflict of interest. Although the
specific rules for dual agency differ by location, the core requirement
is to act as a neutral party who does not favor either side.

It is crucial to adhere to the precise ethical and legal requirements,
as any misstep could lead to a lawsuit or the loss of your license. You
must obtain written permission from both the buyer and the seller, and
your CRM can store this documentation for closing and record-keeping.
You should also clearly explain the limits of the advice you can offer
during negotiations. While you are obligated to transmit required
information, such as lead paint disclosures, you cannot provide
confidential advice on negotiation strategies that would benefit one
party at the expense of the other. Your CRM can help you keep certain
information, such as the seller’s promotional activities and
listing-showing feedback, private from the buyer.

Your CRM provides a **paper trail of the transaction**. This is useful
for protecting yourself long after the deal is closed. Most agents won’t
face a lawsuit or an IRS audit. However, if you stay in business long
enough, the likelihood increases. Real estate is complex, and deals can
fall apart in many ways.

Your CRM will integrate with cloud providers, such as Google Drive, for
**file storage**. This will let you upload documents like contracts,
inspection reports, closing documents, approvals, and other
transaction-related materials. With this setup, you can access these
documents from your smartphone at any time. When clients or cooperating
agents need a document, you can quickly retrieve it from anywhere. This
organized access prevents delays, avoids version mix-ups, and
demonstrates a professional level of control during closing.

Imagine a client’s baby suffers from lead poisoning traced back to a
home you just sold them. If you properly documented the lead paint
disclosure and archived the email conversations in your CRM’s service
report, you are protected. The same principle applies to an IRS audit.
Your CRM provides an organized record of business expenses. This level
of documentation is your best defense, offering peace of mind and legal
protection.

Your real estate CRM’s ability to assign **multiple transactions** to a
single contact record helps you handle complex situations. For example,
you can manage a client selling their current home while buying a new
one, or oversee an investor’s entire property portfolio. This feature is
a hallmark of a **relational database**. It lets you link multiple
transaction records to a single contact, making it easier to manage
several deals for the same client. This relational structure also
applies to all involved parties. You can quickly view all closings with
a particular loan officer or track all deals from a major referrer.
These advanced tracking features are often missing in generic CRMs,
which is a key reason a specialized real estate system is essential for
serious professionals.

Ultimately, handling a closing tests an agent’s professionalism. The
process, from managing contingencies and timelines to coordinating with
all parties, is complex. Thankfully, your real estate CRM provides the
essential framework for navigating this complexity and ensures every
detail is tracked. This thorough documentation offers legal protection
and helps build trust with your client. A smoothly executed closing
leaves a positive final impression, solidifying your reputation and
encouraging post-closing loyalty and referrals.

The closing date is not the end of your relationship; it’s the start of
the next phase of client nurturing. Immediately after closing, enter the
closing date into the client’s contact record as a permanent annual date
in your CRM. Some CRMs automatically add this information when you
update the closing status to complete. This triggers an annual
**closing-anniversary reminder**, allowing you to send a small gift,
make a personalized call, or provide a yearly CMA. By treating the
closing anniversary as an annual touchpoint, you ensure the client never
forgets you, cementing your role as their “Agent for Life” and securing
future referral opportunities.

## Post-Closing

After helping a buyer find and purchase a home, it’s customary to give
them a closing gift. Your gift should be thoughtful yet affordable. The
best time to give it is after the buyer has taken possession and moved
in. Stop by to deliver the gift. This is a good opportunity to make sure
everything is in order. Did the seller take anything they shouldn’t
have, like a bathroom mirror? If so, you might need to contact the
seller or their agent to resolve any last-minute issues.

I recommend waiting until now to pick up your yard sign. Why? This is
the perfect time to take media photos of your happy client standing in
front of the sold sign at their new home. You can share these on social
media to show others that you are an agent who gets results and makes
clients happy.


> **Signs of Success Secret:** Ask your clients on closing day if you can take and share a celebratory photo of them holding their new keys or standing with your Sold sign. A happy client is the strongest proof that you are an effective agent. Posting these photos on your social media feed is far more convincing to future clients than a stack of written testimonials.


If the grass hasn’t been mowed, consider sharing contact information for
a trusted lawn service to tidy it up for the first time. The buyer is
likely busy with moving, and mowing the lawn is the last thing on their
mind. They might be transitioning from an apartment and may not even own
a lawnmower, making this gesture even more thoughtful. You can use the
vendor list in your CRM to recommend a reliable service you trust, or
connect your buyer with a known neighborhood provider (such as a local
kid who mows lawns). Offering a few excellent contacts for immediate
local needs is a highly effective way to provide quick relief for your
client.

For a thoughtful, practical **housewarming gift**, consider items that
enhance safety or enjoyment. If the house lacks a working smoke or
carbon monoxide (CO) detector, purchasing one is a prudent safety
measure. Alternatively, a gift card to a popular local restaurant
encourages your client to explore their new neighborhood. If your
clients are excited about gardening in their new home, tulip bulbs or
seed packets make excellent gifts. By selecting a gift that demonstrates
your attention to detail and understanding of their new environment, you
show you see them as a friend, providing a great way to transition your
relationship from real estate agent to friend now that the deal is done.

A memorable housewarming gift idea is a custom watercolor portrait of
your client’s new home. It’s a personal, high-touch gesture that clients
can display for years, serving as a subtle, lasting reminder of your
service. Or, how about a custom welcome mat with the buyer’s last name?
It’s something the homeowner will see every day, reminding them of you.
They will probably need one since they just moved in. Be sure to order
it in advance if you’re getting a personalized one.

After closing is the ideal time to review who recommended this client to
you. If it was an agent, you’ll have the referral fee and their contact
information in your CRM. Now is the perfect moment to call them and
thank them one last time for their recommendation. You can also share
how happy your shared client is with their new home. That media photo
you did for your social media posts would be a perfect attachment to an
email to them as well. If someone else recommended your client to you,
now is a great time to call and thank them for that recommendation. You
can share how excited their friend is about the new home they just
bought. You might also consider sending a short handwritten note and a
small physical gift, like a bottle of Jack Daniel’s or a gift card to
the local steakhouse.


> **The Basket Bridge Secret:** When giving a gift to new homeowners, consider offering them a basket of items bought at a local farmer’s market, such as bread, honey, cheese, wine, or crafts. You could even use this as a chance to talk with local business owners and let them know you are introducing their products to a new resident, strengthening your relationship with them.


Your CRM will remind you to follow up with anyone who recommended you.
You can also use your CRM to review lead sources at the end of the year
to understand if there were any standout referral sources. You should
add any standout sources to your “Top100” category for those contact
records.

After giving any closing gift, make sure to add a note in your CRM that
states something like, “8/23/2025 - Gave watercolor portrait of home at
closing.” This simple step is crucial for maintaining long-term
relationships. It helps prevent you from giving the same gift to a
repeat client years later. It also gives you a personal detail you can
reference in future conversations, like during their closing anniversary
call, to show your attentiveness.

When someone buys a new home and moves in, a thoughtful gesture would be
to host a housewarming party and invite the neighbors. This is
especially effective if the home is on your geographic farm and you have
already done door-knocking in the area. Neighbors are usually curious
about a new neighbor and might want to stop by to say hi. So, it’s a
great opportunity for your buyer to meet the neighbors and for you to
strengthen your relationship with them.

The task management features of your CRM will help you manage all tasks
that need to be completed after closing. You will need to **update your
buyer’s address** to the new home address, set an annual reminder for
the **closing anniversary**, pick up your lockbox, and sign. You should
also add your client to your “Christmas” category so they receive an
annual Christmas card. It is a great idea to place them on a touch cycle
as well, so you call or visit them every 90 days just to say “hi”.

Once your client has fully moved in, it’s thoughtful to stop by and see
how they’re settling in. Many agents miss the shift from client to
friend. Take time to build a genuine friendship with your former client.
You can offer helpful information about vendors they might need, such as
a house painter or an electrician. As a well-connected member of the
community, you are the perfect person for them to know as they settle
into their new home.

If your client has questions about their new home, such as what a
mysterious light switch does, offer to ask the seller. Small gestures
make all the difference between a satisfied client and a thrilled one.

The best time to secure future business is when your client is happy and
settled in their new home. You should delay the direct ask for new
business until you visit them a few weeks after closing, once they have
had a chance to settle in. When you stop by, make a direct, confident
ask for referrals and online reviews. Say that the highest compliment
they can give is entrusting you with the business of their friends and
family. Explain that you keep your business strong through client
referrals like theirs. Then send a direct link to your preferred review
sites via text or email, and note the request in their CRM contact
record. By timing the request for maximum appreciation, you turn a happy
client into an immediate, active source of new leads. I do not recommend
asking every former client for a review. Not every client will be
thrilled with how things went, and you should only ask people to leave a
review if you are confident they had a positive experience.
