# Finding Your Perfect CRM

—Wayne and Lynn Morgan, *How to Get Rich in Real Estate... And Have a
Life!*

The primary role of a real estate agent is to act as a matchmaker,
connecting buyers and sellers to close a deal. As an insider, you know
how challenging that can be. Finding the right home for the buyer at a
fair price is difficult enough. But there are also the complexities of
inspections, loans, high-stakes life events, and the economy. And we
haven’t even touched on the personalities involved! 

An essential tool for this is your real estate CRM[1]. Your CRM helps
you find new clients and maintain relationships with past clients,
friends, and family. It also helps you track the many details needed to
identify buyers and sellers, match them, and help them successfully
close their sales.

Much like you act as a matchmaker for buyers and sellers, this chapter
acts as a matchmaker for you and your CRM. We will help you identify the
features to look for and the pitfalls to avoid in a CRM. We will also
assist you in connecting your CRM to other services you’re already using
and discuss how it can serve as the backbone of growth for your real
estate career.

## Real Estate CRM Benefits

You can think of a real estate CRM as a Swiss Army knife, offering many
features in one tool. It stores your contact list and personal details
for each person, including birthdays, spouse’s name, children, pets, and
more. You can organize contacts to **print mailing labels** for your
Christmas cards. It also tracks your listings and closings, calculates
commissions, and monitors your income and expenses. Additionally, it
manages showings, showing feedback, offers, and contingencies.


You can communicate via email, phone, or text messages, as well as print
mail-merged letters. Your CRM can even help you schedule follow-ups
using the **touch cycle**, an automated, repeating reminder to contact a
specific person after a set period, such as every 90 days.


> **Millennial Minute Secret:** Don’t forget to take advantage of the text message chat functionality of your CRM. Many people screen their calls, or can’t answer because they are at work. Around 75% of millennials prefer texting over calling, with that figure rising to 80% among Gen Z. Around 25% of this age group avoid answering the phone altogether.


You can track your **appointments** and sync them with your smartphone.
This way, you never miss another appointment.

You can also track the activities you need to complete using your **task
list**. For the people you need to contact each day, your CRM can
generate a **daily contact list.** Your daily call list is a list of
people you need to contact. While you might call these people, you could
instead send a text message, drive by to say hello, or print a letter.
By allowing yourself some flexibility in how you reach out, you increase
the likelihood of completing that task. The primary benefit of using a
daily contact list instead of scheduling appointments in your calendar
is that once you reach out to someone, you can mark the task as
completed, which automatically updates that person’s last contact date
to today. If that person was on a 90-day touch cycle, a new task to
contact them again in 90 days would be generated. This level of
automation makes it easy to call multiple people each day and track who
has been called and who still needs to be contacted.

One of the main benefits of using a real estate CRM is access to a
**collection of ready-made content**. This includes flyer templates,
eCards, and letters. By starting with these pre-written materials and
customizing them, you can quickly complete tasks that would otherwise
take hours. The **letter library** also serves as a source of
inspiration, offering templates for standard sales pitches across
various marketing niches, including new home buyers, retirement
downsizing, second home buyers, FSBOs, expired listings, and more. Most
agents create their own tweaked versions of the letters, allowing them
to tailor the content to their specific requirements.

There are also several capabilities in a real estate CRM that you could
never do on your own. These include the ability to set up a
**time-release drip sequence** of printed letters or emails. Your CRM
schedules them and, for emails, even sends them automatically at the
correct date and time. The letters are mail-merged so that personal
details such as the prospect’s name, the property’s address, a mailing
address, and other personalized information are inserted. Doing these
activities manually would be quite challenging, as each person in a drip
sequence is at a different stage in the process.

One key capability you gain by using a real estate CRM is automation. I
mentioned email drip sequences, which is one form of automation. You can
also automatically feed all your leads into your CRM via **email feed**,
which converts email notifications from your websites and other lead
sources into prospect records. That way, all your leads are centralized
in one location, and you are automatically notified when a new lead is
added. This is critical, as responding quickly to new leads maximizes
the likelihood of conversion. A few examples of lead sources include IDX
websites, your personal website, and commercial websites such as Zillow,
Trulia, Realtor.com, Redfin, and many others.

Another source of leads is lead aggregators such as RedX,
ForeclosuresDaily, and USProbateLeads, which gather information on
expired listings, FSBOs, vacant homes, probate properties, and
pre-foreclosure. You would import that data into your real estate CRM
using **valet import**, a service in which your CRM vendor sets up a
custom importer for that specific lead source. Your CRM vendor would set
up a custom menu item just for you, making it easy to import data from
that source each week. The level of automation this provides can be
significant for agents pursuing these kinds of leads.

The **Google sync** integration syncs your smartphone contacts and
calendar with your CRM. You can also use the built-in **open house
registration** form on your iPad to register attendees at your open
houses. The **call capture** feature in your CRM automatically gathers
phone numbers, caller ID information, and messages from callers to your
automated hotline number listed on your yard signs.

By leveraging your CRM’s integration features, you can use it as your
command center to maintain a **unified address book**—a merged database
of all contacts and leads from all the systems you use. Don’t
underestimate the power of having everything in one place. It’s much
easier to quickly find a contact or send a bulk email to a group when
everything is stored together and carefully merged with no duplication
or missing information. The last thing you want is to send the same
email to the same person multiple times because of duplication in your
system.


One often overlooked advantage of using a real estate CRM is its ability
to streamline your operations. As you gain more experience, you’ll
develop checklists of standard procedures for each listing and closing.
You’ll identify systems that, when implemented, give you the best
results for nurturing leads. Your real estate CRM lets you organize
these checklists using **task plans**, prebuilt, automated checklists of
steps you can apply to any lead or transaction.

When your business is small, you might manage these checklists in your
head or on a scrap of paper. As your business expands, you’ll find you
can’t handle more than one or two listings and closings at a time
without forgetting something. This could have serious consequences, as
missing something important—like returning the key to the seller after
making a copy—can significantly affect the impression you leave.

Using the **transaction management** features in your real estate CRM
allows you to track all of the activities for your listing. No matter
how many listings you manage at once, you can handle them efficiently.
This is especially important in an industry where most of your business
occurs during just a few busy summer months. **You can track parties,
documents, deadlines, contingencies, showings, showing feedback,
promotions, offers, and each party involved in a transaction.** With the
touch cycle, you can maintain regular contact with your client, any
referring agent, as well as the agent on the other side of the
transaction.

You can use your CRM’s **commission and expense-tracking** features to
monitor cash flow. This is especially helpful given the business’s
seasonal nature. While you might have a cash cushion in the fall, it’s
vital to be sure you have enough cash reserves to last through the
winter. Your CRM can assist by comparing last year’s results with this
year’s. Additionally, these seasonal comparisons can serve as early
indicators of an economic downturn, helping you identify if sales are
slower than at the same time last year.

**Real estate calculators** help you educate your clients and provide
useful insights into each client’s unique financial circumstances and
needs. The seller’s net calculator gives your sellers a clear estimate
of how much cash they will walk away with after closing. Likewise, the
buyer’s net calculator helps buyers understand their financial
obligations at closing. You can also calculate maximum loan amounts and
mortgage payments to help your buyers determine a suitable price range
before meeting with a loan officer. The rent-versus-own calculator helps
determine which option makes the most financial sense for your client’s
specific situation.


As your business expands, use your CRM to review the leads you’re
generating and how many are closing. This gives you a clear view of your
**sales funnel**, which starts with unqualified leads and moves them
toward qualification and, eventually, clients. This will help you make
informed decisions about which marketing efforts are effective and which
are not. You can then adjust your marketing strategies accordingly. With
insights into your sales pipeline and past results, you can plan for
seasonal changes common in the real estate market by creating a budget.

Over time, you might notice opportunities to delegate tasks to an
assistant. Once again, your real estate CRM can help. The process you
used to automate, systematize, and scale your business can now be
enhanced by assigning tasks to your assistant through your CRM. You can
use your CRM’s **multi-user** features to access information
simultaneously with your assistant, even on a different computer. This
way, you can review your assistant’s changes to make sure everything is
going as planned. If your assistant runs into a problem, you can quickly
find out what’s wrong and step in to help.

Finally, you can hold yourself accountable for prospecting and follow-up
by using the **goal-tracking** feature in your CRM. This helps ensure
you stay on track with your prospecting efforts and keep your sales
pipeline full. You can also work with a coach to enhance your efforts.
Once again, your CRM can be used to track progress and confirm that you
are achieving the goals you set.

Your real estate CRM lets you manage two lists of people. The first is
your **contacts database**, which includes friends, family, other
agents, past clients, vendors, and anyone else you personally know. The
second is your **prospects database**, which contains strangers. These
are people you might have met at an open house, or those with an FSBO or
expired listing whom you plan to contact to offer your services. Keeping
two databases allows you to regularly clean your prospects database, as
over time you will learn that some people will never work with you. You
can archive and delete them from your database.

Your contacts are different. This group includes both your personal
sphere (friends, family, past clients) and your professional network
(vendors, lenders, agents). These are people you know and interact with
daily. You should sync your contacts with your smartphone’s address book
so you can call them easily. You will also use categories to organize
these contacts for marketing and communication. Since your prospects’
database consists of strangers, it’s better not to sync it with your
smartphone’s address book.

For agents without access to an MLS, a **homes or properties database**
is a valuable CRM feature. This database lets you build a list of
properties in your market area and collect statistical data on those
properties. Another way to use the homes database is to maintain a list
of properties an investor owns and also to monitor off-market inventory.
This is especially useful for commercial properties, which are often not
listed on a centralized MLS.

## How to Pick a CRM

While features are essential, several other factors should be considered
when choosing the right real estate CRM. I cannot overstate the
importance of **complementary training** and technical support provided
by staff based in the US or Canada. You will need assistance with
onboarding, which includes getting started. You will also need help
using your CRM’s features. Additionally, your CRM’s staff should help
integrate it with other products, such as lead services and websites,
and support importing data from existing sources.

Instructional video tutorials are popular and well-suited for learning
simple tasks, such as sending a bulk email or setting up a drip
sequence. However, complimentary **phone support** can be extremely
helpful because it allows you to get an answer quickly. While I hope the
software you select is bug-free, there is always a possibility you will
encounter a bug or issue, and phone support is usually the best way to
resolve it quickly.

Another important factor is the availability of a **free trial**. That
way, you can compare the features of a few CRMs. Buying a real estate
CRM isn’t like buying groceries. Each CRM targets a slightly different
audience and will have a slightly different user interface and support
options. The free trial lets you try the software before you commit. You
can see how easy the product is to learn and use, evaluate technical
support responsiveness, and check for glitches. The trial period is also
the ideal time to confirm that the vendor provides the complimentary,
hands-on onboarding you will need if you decide to subscribe.

Sometimes features sound better than they really are, and being able to
try them helps you understand how practical your new CRM will be.
Ultimately, the best CRM is the one you use regularly. If your CRM is
hard to learn or operate, it undermines its purpose[2]. You should
choose a CRM that is **easy to learn and use**. This way, you pick a
vendor and software product that works for you.

Sometimes people impulsively buy a CRM, believing the purchase will
motivate them to use it because they would feel guilty about paying for
something they aren’t using. They think the more expensive the CRM, the
more likely they are to use it, because if they don’t, they will feel
even worse! Instead of trying to make yourself feel guilty, set small
goals and reward yourself when you achieve them. Also, set a regular
schedule in your calendar to log in to your CRM. Trying to make yourself
feel bad won’t spur you to use your CRM.

Most real estate CRMs include features for working with an assistant or
partner. However, not all are designed for assistants who are new or
have little to no training. Because of this, I recommend choosing a CRM
that is very forgiving of mistakes. Pick a real estate CRM that can
**track changes** and identify who made them. Actions such as sending a
bulk email should include **safeguards to prevent accidental errors**.
Not every assistant is highly skilled, so you need to account for the
possibility that your CRM will be used by someone who is not as
competent as you are. 


You also need the ability to **undelete records** that were accidentally
changed or deleted. While your assistant is hopefully skilled and
cautious, that’s not always guaranteed. The last thing you want is to
hire an assistant only to find out they accidentally mess up your
database without realizing it. You should also look for the ability to
undo changes. For example, if your assistant accidentally deleted all
the notes in a contact record, the CRM should offer the option to
**restore the record** to a previous version of that contact, such as
from a day or a week earlier.


> **The Assistant Accident Secret:** As your team expands, the chance that a team member accidentally deletes a record increases. Make sure your CRM can undelete a record or revert it to a previous version from yesterday or last week. Mistakes do happen.


Your real estate CRM should be able to connect with a wide range of
**third-party integrations**, including lead services, IDX websites, PPC
advertising, open house registration software, SMS texting services,
your smartphone, lockbox software, and mailing houses. You might already
use these services and want to integrate them into your CRM, or you
might want the flexibility to try different third-party services over
time. Be sure to discuss available integrations with your CRM vendor and
ask for help connecting your existing third-party services during your
free trial.

All modern CRMs are **cloud-based**, so you’re protected if your
computer crashes, is stolen, or gets infected with a virus. With a
cloud-based system, you can switch devices seamlessly, and your data
won’t be lost if your hard drive crashes.

## CRM Dangers & Pitfalls

There are several pitfalls when selecting a real estate CRM. The most
important consideration is to **choose a CRM specifically designed for
real estate**. A generic CRM won’t meet your needs. As a real estate
agent, you work with families, and a generic CRM won’t handle the
details of tracking family information, such as spouse names, birth
dates, children’s names, and more. While this might seem minor, it’s
important to remember that both the husband and wife typically purchase
a home together. If your communications exclude one of them, you’re
already at a disadvantage.

A generic CRM also lacks essential features such as real estate
calculators and income and expense tracking. Transaction management,
another real estate-specific feature, includes monitoring listings,
showings, offers, contingencies, and the parties involved. Real estate
is a unique industry, and a basic CRM will lack a content library for
flyers, eCards, and letters, as well as automated drip sequences.

A second pitfall to watch for is using an all-in-one CRM that bundles a
website and paid lead services. I recommend that you **avoid purchasing
your CRM, lead service, and website from the same vendor**. While this
might seem like a good idea at first, it forces you to use all three
services together. If you’re dissatisfied with one, you have to cancel
all three to make a change. Instead, leverage your real estate CRM’s
integration features to add third-party services. If your lead service
or website isn’t delivering the results you need, you can then fire them
while keeping your CRM.

When it comes to websites, there are many types you can create, and
their costs vary. If you use a website included with your CRM, your
options are limited, reducing your flexibility. Trends in the industry
have made it harder to justify high-end websites, as getting your
website noticed has become more challenging amid stiff competition from
other agents and services like Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com[3]. You
may decide that money spent on a high-end website is better allocated
elsewhere, which is why it’s best to buy your website from a vendor
other than the one that supplies your CRM.

One last point about buying an all-in-one solution is that the price is
usually much higher than that of a standalone real estate CRM, even when
including the cost of additional services purchased separately. In some
cases, the monthly expenses for these all-in-one solutions are
comparable to a car payment.

**Be cautious of sneaky contract terms.** It’s best to choose a vendor
that offers either a monthly plan or a prorated refund. That way, if
you’re unhappy with your vendor, you can cancel without penalties,
giving you more control. If the vendor requires that you sign a
non-refundable one-year contract, this suggests they lack confidence in
their CRM’s competitiveness. They probably think that once you start
using the system, you’ll regret your decision and will immediately want
to cancel. I recommend working only with vendors that allow you to
cancel at any time, or at most, on a month-by-month contract.

Some vendors charge extra for **onboarding**—the setup process for your
CRM. Onboarding should be free and not incur additional costs.
Onboarding typically includes assistance with transferring your database
and installing letterhead with your company logo and portrait photo.
Also included is complimentary training and help setting up
synchronization with your smartphone, SMS text messaging, and any other
integrations you intend to use, such as feeding leads into your CRM,
either live or through the valet import process.

If you’re interested in what other agents think about the CRM you’re
considering, check out the online reviews on Google and BBB. Some review
sites, such as G2, Capterra, Top10, and Forbes, may hide negative
reviews and pay for positive ones. Because of this, they shouldn’t be
considered completely unbiased, especially since vendors can pay these
sites to post positive reviews.

**Review your CRM vendor’s privacy policy**. While some vendors clearly
state that your entered data remains private, some have policies that
allow them to profit from your data through integrated services and
cross-marketing.

Lone Wolf Software’s platform, which includes its transaction management
solutions, features an Agent Marketplace[4]. This marketplace allows
you, the agent, to connect clients with service providers such as
mortgage brokers, home warranty companies, home insurance providers, and
title companies during the transaction process. Lone Wolf earns revenue
through its business relationships with these service providers, who
either pay to be integrated into the platform or pay referral fees for
transactions facilitated by the platform. Although you help facilitate
these connections, Lone Wolf does not share revenue from these
platform-driven referrals with you.

Zillow Group, which acquired the Follow Up Boss (FUB) CRM, can match a
contact in your FUB database to a Zillow account holder, creating a
“mutual customer.”[5] For these mutual customers, Zillow may use the
private information in your CRM—including your notes—to market services
to your clients such as Zillow Home Loans, home warranties, and title
insurance. This could place you in an ethical dilemma, as you may be
asked to promote or sell products that are not in your client’s best
interests. Like Lone Wolf, Zillow receives financial compensation from
these referrals. You, the agent, do not receive financial benefit from
Zillow’s marketing of its in-house services to your client base.

Two additional products with similar conflicts are CINC and RealGeeks,
both owned by Fidelity National Financial (FNF), the largest title and
settlement services company in the country[6]. From RealGeeks’ privacy
policy: “We may provide Personal Information and Usage Information to
our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and other businesses or persons
for the purposes of processing such information on our behalf and
promoting the products and services of our trusted business
partners.”[7]

This approach is similar to the cross-marketing strategy banks use. One
key difference between a bank and a real estate agent is that real
estate agents are independent contractors, and the way this information
is shared does not allow you, the agent, to benefit financially from it.

While these conflicts don’t necessarily make that CRM a poor choice,
it’s helpful to understand each CRM’s policy. If your clients receive
spam emails from an affiliate of your CRM vendor, it’s good to know why.
You should also be aware of whether your CRM vendor is using the notes
in your CRM. Don’t automatically assume that the data you enter into
your CRM is private.

Some CRM vendors treat your private data as just that—private. To find
those vendors, review their privacy policies. Look for a clear,
straightforward statement affirming that your data is yours and will not
be shared. Two vendors with the strictest privacy policies are
RealtyJuggler and WiseAgent, but the vendors listed below also offer
reasonably strong protections.

## CRM Quick Pick List

**RealtyJuggler**: The most affordable real estate CRM with a
comprehensive feature set, including transaction management, an
extensive content library, calculators, and expense and income tracking.
They offer a long free trial, phone support, an excellent privacy
policy, and a prorated refund for canceling at any time.

**Realvolve**: An advanced real estate CRM specializing in sophisticated
workflow automation. This system is designed for experienced agents and
real estate teams. Its robust process automation streamlines complex
client follow-up plans. The platform also includes features that promote
team accountability. It is best suited for experienced agents and teams
who require detailed control. It offers a free trial but no phone
support, and its advanced features come with a steep learning curve.

**WiseAgent**: A relatively affordable real estate CRM with an extensive
set of features, including lead generation, landing pages, transaction
management, and a web app. Offers a free trial, an excellent privacy
policy, and 24-hour phone support.

**Referral Maker**: Emphasizes referrals as the primary lead source,
built on the Buffini “Work by Referral” system. It offers excellent
activity and goal tracking. Slightly more expensive than the other
recommendations, but it offers multiple pricing tiers, some of which
include coaching. The feature set focuses on the early stages of the
sales funnel.

**iXact Contact**: A relatively affordable real estate CRM with a solid
feature set. They offer agent websites and a monthly newsletter. They
were acquired by Elm Street Technologies in 2021.

## Your Broker’s CRM

Some brokerages offer their agents a “free” real estate CRM. While this
might seem like an excellent option, there are many drawbacks to using a
free CRM. Phone support is likely missing, along with many features.
Most brokers choose their free CRM not for features, ease of use, or
technical support; they pick the cheapest vendor. It’s like going
grocery shopping and only buying the least expensive items. Canned yams
for dinner again. Yum!

You may have outgrown your current brokerage and be considering a switch
to a new one. However, you’re concerned about how you’ll transfer your
database and are hesitant to learn a new CRM at the new firm. There’s a
better way. Why not buy your own CRM? That way, you can choose the one
that best fits your needs rather than being stuck with the one your
broker picked. Since each CRM vendor is competing for your business, you
can always switch to another if you’re unhappy with pricing, support, or
features. This keeps each CRM vendor motivated to stay competitive,
thanks to the power of capitalism.

Another disadvantage of a free broker CRM is poor email deliverability.
Maintaining a good sending reputation with email servers requires
significant effort and investment. On a free platform, the
unprofessional sending habits of one agent can harm the deliverability
for all other agents using the system. Without a financial incentive to
monitor the network, the platform’s overall reputation can decline,
causing your legitimate emails to land in the junk folder.


That’s why some free CRM vendors won’t even show email open rates. The
**email open rate** is an important marketing metric that measures the
percentage of recipients who open an email among those who received it.
This is sometimes called email engagement. Just sending an email isn’t
enough; you also need to make sure it’s delivered and read. Typical open
rates are around 30%[8]. If your open rate is low, talk with your CRM
vendor about ways to improve it. Reputable CRM vendors will have a
**postmaster,** who is a person responsible for ensuring compliance with
federal regulations and maintaining a good reputation with email service
providers.

Some vendors that offer a free real estate CRM provide a basic product
at no cost and offset lost revenue by charging extra for add-on
services. I recommend asking your CRM vendor which features incur
additional costs and whether the free version has any limitations.

One feature a free CRM is likely to lack is onboarding. Onboarding
involves setting up your CRM, including importing data from various
sources, merging duplicates, and creating a unified address book. After
importing, your contacts and calendar sync with your smartphone, so you
can access them on the go. Onboarding also includes installing your
**letterhead**, which features a portrait photo of you and a company
logo, typically placed at the top of all your emails and printed
letters.

Onboarding also includes training on your CRM’s features. Most free CRMs
lack training options. Understanding how to use your CRM is crucial, and
that’s another reason free CRMs are often not the best choice. Look for
a CRM vendor that offers **complimentary one-on-one training** — a
scheduled session tailored to your specific needs. You can learn about a
new feature, get help configuring an integration (such as an email
feed), or ask questions about functionality. Because you are in the
driver’s seat, you won’t have to endure a lengthy sales presentation.
Instead, at the end of the training, you will have achieved something
practical. Common training sessions would include organizing your
database for a Christmas card mailing, sending a bulk email, or
customizing a drip mail sequence to meet your unique requirements.


> **The Database Ditch Secret:** Never let your database be held hostage. Some CRMs intentionally limit their export features to trap you with their product. Perform a full data export at least once a year. This ensures you can walk away from any vendor or brokerage with your business fully intact.


Another factor to consider is your ability to stand out with a free CRM.
If you’re using the same tools as everyone else, can you offer your
clients something better than other agents provide? Using your own real
estate CRM helps you stand out, like someone wearing a red dress in a
sea of black. A clear example of this differentiation is your ability to
deliver a seller **service report**, which summarizes the promotional
activities, showings, and showing feedback for your listing, keeping
your client fully informed. In a slow market, tools like these can help
prepare your client for the possibility that a price adjustment or a
listing extension might be necessary.

When you choose a paid CRM vendor, that vendor is responsible to you.
They will answer your calls, fix bugs, and provide reliable technical
support because they know you are paying them. They understand that if
you become dissatisfied, you will leave and take your business
elsewhere. With a free CRM, there is less motivation to fix bugs, make
improvements, or offer good technical support. Your CRM is a key tool
for organizing and centralizing your activities. Don’t settle for a
subpar product.

A reputable CRM vendor will provide a **free trial**. A free trial
demonstrates the vendor’s confidence that their product can withstand
close scrutiny. Since you’re not obligated to continue, this is the
opposite of a broker-supplied CRM, where you have no choice. In the
first case, the free market system is at work, and you are free to
choose the best CRM for your needs. In the second case, your broker
picks the CRM for you, and you have no say in the decision.

## Changing your CRM

According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the average
agent stays with their current brokerage for about 5 years[9]. Changing
brokerages is a decision that requires careful due diligence. Be honest
with yourself about the impact the change will have on your income and
the disruption it will cause to the leads you’re nurturing before you
make a move. You will also need to coordinate with your old broker to
determine which leads you can take with you and which are owned by your
broker. Using a CRM you control serves as an insurance policy for your
database if you decide to switch brokerages.

If you rely on a broker-provided CRM, your transition will require more
planning. You should transfer your personal contacts to a new CRM you
control before losing access to the old system. A real estate CRM will
help you categorize and separate broker-owned leads.

### Lynn Ganster

Early in her career, Lynn Ganster, an associate broker with Morris
Williams Realty in Titusville, FL, learned a painful lesson: When she
left her previous brokerage, the CRM she relied on and all the contacts
she had built stayed behind. “When I no longer worked there, they would
not allow me access to any data I had left behind,” she recalls. “I
began searching for a CRM but really didn’t know what I was looking
for.” Initially, she cobbled together a solution, rebuilding her contact
database in Outlook and using Excel spreadsheets as a makeshift
transaction management system. While this worked, she would soon outgrow
her cobbled-together solution. This growth led her to realize that
switching to a real estate specific CRM was the only viable way to
manage her real estate business. “I wanted to use something else, but
most systems were too expensive, too complicated, or filled with
features I didn’t need,” she said. Though she had been burned by her
past CRM, she eventually abandoned her makeshift system in favor of a
complete CRM, this time one under her control. “Find a CRM that does
everything you need, and it needs to be easy enough to use so you’ll
still have time to live your life,” she said. New agents might not know
that their contacts won’t follow them if they’re locked into the
brokerage’s CRM. Lynn advises that agents should be careful when
depending upon a brokerage’s system because your CRM is the heart of
your business.

—«◊»—

While changing brokerages might require you to switch CRMs,
dissatisfaction with your current CRM and a desire for something better
are other reasons to switch as well.

Before you begin, it is crucial to clean your existing database. Remove
outdated, inactive leads and, most importantly, ensure that anyone who
has opted out of your emails is permanently removed. Migrating data
without a record of who opted out can seriously harm your email
deliverability, as people will complain if you start sending them emails
again after they have already opted out once.

Once your data is clean, resist the urge to make your new CRM behave
exactly like your old one. Each system has its own strengths, and this
is an excellent opportunity to improve your processes. Review the letter
library and task plans included with your new CRM. They may be better
than your old templates, so you may not need to migrate your old
checklists and mail templates. If you still need to transfer old
letters, you’ll have to do so manually by copying and pasting, since the
mail merge variables and formatting will differ.

Your new CRM vendor can assist with your transition through
**onboarding**, data migration, and configuration of your new CRM. This
is typically a free service offered by the vendor, and I highly
recommend taking advantage of it. While it may seem simple to transfer
your contacts to the new database, the last thing you want is to leave
out a key piece of information — like a spouse’s name or birthdate — and
only realize the problem when it’s too late. It’s best to let the
experts at your CRM vendor handle the process so it’s completed
flawlessly.

You will likely need to transfer your contacts and prospects from
multiple sources, including your computer’s address book, smartphone,
email programs such as Outlook and Apple Mail, the local MLS, and data
from any previous CRM or contact management system. The challenge is
accurately loading and merging all this information. Because each
program uses different data fields, careful mapping is necessary to
avoid data loss. Duplicate records should be merged so each contact has
complete information from all sources. For example, your email program
might contain names and email addresses, while your smartphone might
hold names, phone numbers, and some email addresses.

Ultimately, you want a **unified address** book that consolidates all
these sources. This process is more complex and time-consuming than it
appears and is typically part of onboarding. Free CRM providers are
unlikely to offer this labor-intensive service for free, but a
reputable, full-featured real estate CRM vendor will.

You can also **sync your contacts and calendar** with your smartphone
via Google. This serves two purposes: it lets you access this
information on your mobile device and creates a backup. Cloud services
can sometimes experience outages. Fortunately, outages are rare and
usually short. However, that offers little comfort if you need to work
during an outage. By syncing your contacts and calendar, you ensure you
can access your information even during outages.

During onboarding, you should provide your new vendor with a
professional portrait photo and your company logo so they can set up
your letterhead for a consistent, professional look.

Part of the onboarding process is training. It would be difficult to use
a CRM effectively without training, given the many features and options.
Onboarding helps you identify the key features that will benefit you
quickly, so you don’t waste time on obscure features that won’t help you
become more productive and generate revenue right away.

Beyond the migration process, a professional-grade CRM must include
essential safety features. The first is the ability to undelete
accidentally deleted records and restore a modified record to a previous
version. The second is a detailed **activity log** that shows who made
what changes and when. This log is invaluable for accountability,
training, and diagnosing errors. Together, these features create a vital
safety net and ensure the integrity of your most valuable asset.

When you export your data from your old CRM, it will be in a
**Comma-Separated Values (CSV)** file, a spreadsheet format that can be
opened in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. When you open this file, the
first row contains column titles that match each field in your old CRM.
Because each CRM vendor’s export format varies slightly, converting data
between CRMs is not always straightforward. For example, one vendor
might label the column for a phone number “Mobile Phone,” another might
use “Cell Phone,” and yet another simply “Phone.” That’s why it’s
recommended to take advantage of the onboarding process your new CRM
vendor provides. They can help ensure that each column maps correctly to
the appropriate fields in the new system. The goal of any transfer is to
move as much of—if not all—of the data from your old system to your new
one.

Reputable CRM vendors export data in a standard format, usually a
variation of the format used by **Microsoft Outlook’s CSV export**. This
makes the transfer process much easier. Non-competitive CRM vendors may
export using column names that are difficult or impossible to load into
another CRM. This complicates switching CRMs, as moving to another could
cause you to lose critical information, such as your notes. When
selecting a CRM vendor, a key question to ask is whether the export
format is standardized so the data can be easily imported into a
competing CRM.

If you decide to switch brokerages, your new real estate CRM can help
you notify people in your database of your move. You should personally
reach out to past clients and anyone who has recently referred you. For
everyone else, send a multichannel announcement via postcards, email,
and SMS. If you were using a brokerage-provided email address, plan this
transition carefully. It’s crucial to update your contact information
across all platforms. This announcement not only informs people of your
move but also helps clean up your database.
