<h1>Further Reading</h1>
<p>This book, <em>Real Estate CRM Mastery</em>, is designed for the experienced agent who has mastered the essentials and is ready to scale their production. It covers advanced strategies for managing your time, automating your marketing, and leading a team or an assistant. I have also written a companion book, <em>Real Estate CRM Secrets</em>, which focuses on the fundamental systems a new agent needs to get organized, develop consistent habits, and build their business. Together, these two books offer a complete, repeatable system for transforming a new agent into a top-producing real estate professional.</p>
